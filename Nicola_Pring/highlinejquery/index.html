	<div id="intro"> <p> <div class="firstline"> The High Line is more than just a park&mdash;it's an outdoor art gallery.</div> Completed in 2009, the High Line is an aboveground walkway constructed on old railroad tracks, running Manhattan's west side, from Gansevoort Street to 30th Street. The park often features an eclectic mix of sculptures, sometimes so subtle they blend into the architecture. Along with a few regular fixtures, the High Line is currently hosting <em> Busted </em>, a collection of ancient world-inspired pieces by 10 different artists. <em> Busted, </em> which runs through April of this year, also explores ideas about heroes and public monuments. Follow this guide to the exhibit as you head north along the High Line. </p> </div>
