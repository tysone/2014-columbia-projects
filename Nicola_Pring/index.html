		<p> French electronic group Daft Punk won their first GRAMMY Award for Album of the Year at the 2014 GRAMMYs, beating out huge names including Macklemore & Ryan Lewis and Taylor Swift. Though their 2013 record <em> Random Access Memories </em> was their first major award-winning album, they've been making music for over 20 years. Though they're known for their music and elaborate live shows, they're perhaps best known for their robot disguises. The pair rarely remove their helmets, and they don't do many interviews. When they won on Sunday night, the duo remained silent, and songwriter Paul Williams, who collaborated with them on <em> Random Access Memories</em>, gave a speech on their behalf. </p>

		<h2> Members </h2>

		<p> Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter are the members of Daft Punk. The pair met at school in Paris in 1987. </p>

		<h4> Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo </h4>

		<p> de Homem-Christo is a 39-year-old French native. He began playing electric guitar at age 14. In additon to Daft Punk, he has also been a member of the duo Le Knight Club. He founded the record label Crydamoure in 1997 with Eric Chederville. </p>

		<h4> Thomas Bangalter </h4>

		<p> Bangalter, 39, is originally from Paris. He started playing piano at age 6. In addition to Daft Punk, Bangalter has worked with the bands Stardust and Together.

		<h2> The Band </h2>

		<p> The members of Daft Punk met at Lycee Carnot in Paris in 1987. They became friends and recorded demos together, and in 1992, they formed the Beach Boys-inspired band Darlin' with guitarist Laurent Brancowitz, a founding member of the French rock band Phoenix. The band didn't go far, but the British magazine <em> Melody Maker </em> called their music "a dafty punk thrash," which became the inspiration for de Homem-Christo and Bangalter's next project. </p>

		<p> The new twosome went on to a long career, beginning with the release of several singles, including "The New Wave" and "Da Funk" in the early 1990s, and their debut studio album <em> Homework </em> in 1997. In addition to releasing several other studio albums, they have toured all over the world. </p>

		<p> Daft Punk have made music for several projects including 11 tracks for the 2009 video game <em> DJ Hero </em> and 24 tracks for the 2010 movie <em> Tron: Legacy. </em> </p>

		<p> In their early years, Daft Punk wore masks while performing. They have appeared as cartoons in videos. By the late 1990s, the guys began wearing their signature robot helmets, as well as metallic gloves, when they performed live or did photo shoots. In 2007, Bangalter told Remix Mag Online, "We did not choose to become robots. There was an accident in our studio. We were working on our sampler, and at exactly 9:09 am on September 9, 1999, it exploded. When we regained consciousness, we discovered that we had become robots." </p>
