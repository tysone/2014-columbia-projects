	<div class="text"> <p id="intro-text"> <span class="letter"> L</span>ate on a cloudy Thursday afternoon, Megan and Liz Mace sit cross-legged on queen-sized beds in their room on the 14<sup>th</sup> floor of the Westin Hotel. They are both dressed in black yoga pants and oversized t-shirts and they browse the Internet on their MacBooks as they flip channels on the room’s wide screen TV. </p>

	<p id="intro-text"> The 19-year-old twin singers are T-minus 20 hours and two doors down from the B.B. King Blues Club on 42<sup>nd</sup> Street, the site of their first ever show in New York City. The show, “Band Against Bullying,” will be the first installment in a series of similar shows, which will eventually feature Justin Bieber and other major industry stars. For the up and coming, YouTube-grown duo, it’s a big deal. Though Megan and Liz are right on the verge of their big break, they’re just your average teenage girls. </p>

	 <p> I arrive at the hotel in Times Square a few minutes before our scheduled interview time &mdash; earlier today Liz had asked for help choosing her and Megan’s outfits for our photo shoot. I knock on the door of the girls’ room, and Liz answers and greets me warmly. I step into the room and introduce myself to Megan, who is sitting on her bed catching up on fan messages on Twitter. </p>

	<p> I put my backpack on the floor and set my notebook down on a dresser next to a set of wavy, blond hair extensions and a long silver necklace. The girls lay the contents of their suitcases out on their beds and start choosing outfits for the shoot. </p>

	<p> They explain that they’re exhausted &mdash; they landed in New York early this morning after having waited at the airport in their home city of Nashville all day yesterday for a flight that got canceled, and they spent all day today running around New York doing press and preparing for their show. </p>

	<p> Though they say they’re tired, their exhaustion isn’t apparent. Both girls seem lively and bubbly as they talk about their excitement and nerves for Band Against Bullying. As they sort through the piles of clothing, jewelry and makeup on their beds, they talk and gossip a bit about their friends, like any normal teenagers would. The only difference is that their friends are big names in the music industry &mdash; including the guys from Hot Chelle Rae and Paradise Fears, among others. </p> </div>

		<div class="caption"> Megan and Liz in their hotel room in New York. </div>
		</div>

	<div class="text"> <p> Liz picks through black skinny jeans, a pair of tight, leather pants and several studded leather and denim jackets before settling on the leather pants, a turquoise blouse with a studded collar and a pair of impossibly high, sparkly Jeffrey Campbell heels. </p>

	<p> “I didn’t bring anything that goes with your clothes,” Megan says, surveying Liz’s dark, edgy clothing and turning to her own collection of denim, neon mini skirts and lacy shirts. She eventually chooses a short, lace-covered Urban Outfitters dress and pairs it with one of Liz’s leather jackets and chunky, white wedges. </p>

	 <p> Though Megan and Liz are twins, the differences between them don’t stop at their clothing styles. For one thing, they’re fraternal twins, and they don’t really look at all alike. Megan is a brunette and Liz is blonde, (though her hair is naturally brown) and while both girls are thin and stand at 5-foot-1, their faces bear few similarities. </p>

	<p> For another, their personalities are different. Both girls seem equally friendly, enthusiastic and fun, but Megan explains she’s shy and reserved compared to her sister. </p>

	<p> “Our personalities kind of reversed after high school. Now Liz is always the one planning stuff and meeting new people and I went into this bubble. I’m stepping out of it again, but I’m still working on it,” she says. </p>

	<div class="pull-quote-1"> <span class= "left-quote-1"> “ </span> We do everything together. It’s ridiculous, actually, how much we’re together. It’s like we’re married. </div>

	<p> Despite their differences, the girls are pretty much inseparable, and always have been. They have to be, for their music, but they wouldn’t want it any other way. </p>

	<p> “We do everything together,” Liz says. “It’s ridiculous, actually, how much we’re together. We spend all day, every day together. It’s like we’re married.” It’s a sort of running joke between them &mdash; during our photo shoot in the hotel’s lounge, Liz grabs a big silver ring on Megan’s left hand and poses. “It’s our engagement picture,” she says, laughing. </p>

	<p> We return to the room after the shoot, and the girls immediately shed their heels and jewelry and get comfortable. “Can I throw on my pajamas?” Liz asks as she pulls on a pair of pale pink pajama pants with Scottie dogs on them. Megan swaps her dress for black leggings and t-shirt. The girls suggest we have a “pow wow,” and we all claim spots on the floor between the two beds. </p>

	<p> Liz reaches up to the nightstand and grabs a melting Starbucks iced venti-something that has been sitting in the room since before I got there. She begins to stir it slowly with her straw while Megan pulls a few chestnut brown hair extensions out of her already long hair. She picks up a slim, green bottle of hairspray from the nightstand, examines it for a moment, then sprays it in Liz’s direction. </p>

	<p> “Oh my god,” Liz says, in response to the attack. “You’re so weird.” </p> </div>

	<div class="text"> <p> <span class="letter"> M</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;egan and Liz have always been singing together. The twins were born in Michigan, and their family relocated first to Arizona, then to California before settling in Michigan again, where they moved houses at least every two years. But wherever they lived, the girls were always singing.  </p>

	<p> “We were always singing, and my mom was very encouraging of that,” Megan says. “It was always very comfortable to sing around the house and sing in the shower and not get criticized for it. It was just very normal.”</p>

	<p> The girls say the 1960s R&amp;B song, “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” was always their “go to” song, which they often sang together for their friends and family, and for talent competitions around Michigan. </p> </div>

		<div class="caption"> The girls have been inseparable since they were kids. </div>
		</div>

	<div class="text"> <p> “We always sang together, except for that brief stint in fifth grade when you wanted to do the talent show by yourself,” Liz says, glancing over at her sister. “That hurt, I remember being insulted that you didn’t want to sing with me,” Liz says, with an air of mock resentment in her voice. “I wanted to sing ‘A Moment Like This’ by myself,” Megan replies, playfully defending herself. “I wanted my moment, it wasn’t our moment.” </p>

	<p> But ever since, every moment has been their moment. The girls won first place singing duets in several talent shows, and formed their first band, Hope 3, together with a childhood friend. </p>

	<p> “We wrote our first song when we were 10 years old,” Megan says, remembering the band. “It was awful,” Liz adds. “We’d walk around the playground and we’d be like ‘Hey, can we sing the song we wrote for you?’ We were so proud of it,” Megan says. </p>

	<p> More serious songwriting began when Megan learned to play guitar at age 13. Liz had received a First Act children’s guitar that Christmas, but never picked it up. </p>

	<p> “In January of that year she wasn’t playing it,” Megan says, “and it was winter in Michigan and there’s nothing to do, and I was just so bored so I picked it up one day. I was so bad, I’m sure you remember,” she says to Liz, who responds with a broad smile. </p>

	<p> Inspired by pop-rock singer/songwriter/sister duo Aly &amp; AJ, (now 78violet) Megan kept practicing and continued singing and writing with Liz. The girls leaned heavily on pop music because it was the genre they listened to most. </p>

	<p> “I had Britney Spears posters all over my walls, she was a big Christina Aguilera fan,” Megan explains, gesturing to her sister. “Pop music is amazing and incredible, and we love it.” </p>

	<p> <span class="letter"> I</span>n 2007, at age 14, Megan and Liz discovered YouTube as an outlet for their love of singing and songwriting. On July 23 of that year they created their YouTube channel, “MeganandLiz,” and uploaded their first original song to the site. The song, “This Note,” was shot on Megan and Liz’s webcam. The video features both girls dressed in black turtlenecks standing behind a keyboard as Megan plays chords. </p>

	<p> “I thought I could play piano,” Megan says, remembering the video. “I couldn’t.” “We both didn’t know the song,” Liz says, slightly embarrassed by the memory. “I know,” Megan replies. “I watch it back, and I’m like ‘Why did we think that was good?’” </p> </div>

	<div class="text"> <p> After posting “This Note,” along with a few additional videos of cover songs, they stopped posting for almost a year because of a lack of high-speed Internet in the rural area where they lived, which Liz affectionately calls “the boondocks.” </p>

	<p> By the following year, Megan and Liz got a better Internet connection and began posting videos of themselves covering songs by Demi Lovato, Aly &amp; AJ and Taylor Swift, among others, about once a week. Their videos began to get attention from the YouTube community, and they quickly gained a following.  </p>

 	<p> “Honestly, I think it was timing, and the fact that there’s two of us,” Megan says, of the reason for their success (to date, their YouTube channel has over 700,000 subscribers and nearly 165 million views). “We started right before everybody started figuring out that you could post videos on YouTube and get attention for it,” she says.</p>

	<p> “I feel like if we did it now, nothing would happen,” Liz adds. “It’s so saturated now. But we didn’t have to do anything unusual to stand out. We got in on the ground level.”</p>

	<p> By the time the girls were seniors in high school in Edwardsburg, Mich., their careers were beginning to take off. They took some time away from school and finished classes online while they worked. And while their friends busied themselves with the SATs and writing essays for college applications, Megan and Liz continued to work on their music. </p>

	<p> “It was actually surprisingly easy,” Megan says, of their decision not to go to college. “Everybody else was applying to colleges and Liz and I just weren’t because we were so dead set on music. We just knew we didn’t want to go.” </p>

		<div class="pull-quote-2"> <span class= "left-quote-2"> “ </span> YouTube is a great place to grow up, but it's not a great place to live. </div>

	<p> Both girls liked school and graduated with impressive GPAs, but knew college was not for them. </p>

	<p> “College wasn’t where my heart was,” Megan says. “When it came down to choosing what was going to make me happy in the long run, it was going to be music.” </p>

	<p> Liz agrees. “Some people put their all into college and it works out because they do well in college and then they get an awesome job,” Liz says. “We wouldn’t put our all into college. We put our all into this, and we’re really happy with what we’re doing.” </p>

	<p> Just before their friends packed up and went off to school, Megan and Liz left Michigan and moved to Nashville, Tenn. with their mother to pursue music, leaving their father, grandmother and most other members of their family behind. The frequent change they experienced as children prepared them for the move, and they both say they were excited, rather than scared. </p>

	<p> “Our real family is pretty much our mom, so it wasn’t as hard as everybody thought it would be,” Liz says. </p>

	<p> The girls love living in Nashville, and agree they never want to live in Los Angeles. </p>

	<p> “L.A.’s so intimidating. Everybody moves out there to be a movie star or a singer. In Nashville it’s very homegrown and a lot of people who just love music,” Megan says. </p>

	<p> “You can feel it.” “L.A. is a lot of pressure and a lot of stress, and Nashville’s just easygoing, it lets you be who you want to be,” Liz says. </p>

	<p> When they moved to Nashville, Megan and Liz began working with a management company that signed them to their small, indie label, upgraded them from a webcam to an HD camera and coached them to be more comfortable on film. </p>

	<p> “I’m really glad that they helped us step up our game because if we went right into the next level without any on-camera experience, it would have failed because we wouldn’t have been ready for it,” Megan says. “It was kind of like video boot camp for a year.” </p> </div>

	<div class="text"> <p> The experience paid off &mdash; the production value of the girls’ videos has skyrocketed, and the Megan and Liz YouTube arsenal now contains beauty and style and advice videos along with music. They’ve also released dozens of original songs and several high quality, professional music videos. </p>

	<p> Now, Megan and Liz and their team are working to transition the twins from YouTube stars into mainstream musicians. </p> 

	<p> “YouTube is a great place to grow up,” Megan says, “but it’s not a great place to live,” she and Liz say in unison, as if it’s an old adage they’ve heard and repeated a million times before. The girls feel as if their YouTube career has run its course &mdash; as thankful as they are that the site helped them to get them to where they are today, they’re bored. </p>

	<p> “We’re ready to step up the game,” Megan says. “We want to go to a whole ‘nother level,” Liz says, in agreement. “It’s scary, but we’re ready for it.” </p>

	<p> Their trip to New York for Band Against Bullying is just the beginning. </p>

	<p> <span class="letter"> O</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;n July 31, the girls’ newest single, “Bad For Me,” debuted on iTunes. At the time of our interview, Megan and Liz are both gushing with excitement for its release. The song, which, according to the girls, is about “that guy that’s a jerk but you love him anyway,” is a step in a new direction. “Bad For Me” marks a move away from the sweet, Disney-like songs the girls have written in the past, which generally appeal to an audience of pre-teen and young teenage girls. </p>

	<p> Megan and Liz co-wrote “Bad For Me” with Martin Johnson of Boys Like Girls, who forced them to work on an older sound. </p> 

	 <p> “Martin was very honest,” Megan says. “I suggested a song title and he was like ‘No, that sounds like a 14-year-old would sing it.’ Throughout the whole thing he made us keep it like 19-year-olds, and I cannot thank him enough for doing that. I never realized that that was something Liz and I had a problem doing.” </p>

	<p> Megan and Liz think “Bad For Me” will appeal to girls who are 18 and older. </p>

	<p> “This is the first song [we’ve written] where we were forced to not play it safe. The song is definitely a game changer for us,” Liz says. </p>

	<p> That’s not to say the song won’t appeal to a younger crowd as well &mdash; since writing “Bad For Me,” Megan and Liz are striving to find balance on the fine line between campy, teen pop and a more mature sound in all of their songs. </p> 

	<p> “This is the song that we base all the other songs we write on,” Liz explains, talking about the writing process for the full-length album they’ve been working on since they moved to Nashville, which they hope to release in the coming months. “It’s like ‘How does this relate to ‘Bad For Me?’ How does this relate to the quality and the content of ‘Bad For Me?’” </p> </div>

		<div class="video"> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZgLs_0KIXM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <div class="caption"> Megan and Liz consider “Bad For Me” a turning point in their careers. </div> </div>

	<div class="text"> <p> The girls are making sure their image strikes a similar balance between teen and young adult. </p>

	<p> “We want to keep our image clean because we want 15-year-olds and their moms to listen to our music, but we also want to sing songs that are relatable to 18 plus,” Liz says. “It’s about finding that line in between that’s really hard to stay on and to not go above or below. That’s what the challenge is now. It’s to be classy,” she says. “But to be edgy, too,” Megan adds. </p>

	<p> The girls agree walking that fine line is difficult, and as their spotlight begins to brighten, it’s likely to become even more challenging. They certainly don’t behave like typical, young pop stars, and it doesn’t seem as if they will in the future. </p>

	<p> Both girls love Miley Cyrus, but it’s unlikely that either will get caught on video smoking from a bong, pole dance on stage or do anything else extreme any time soon &mdash; earlier, as we rode the hotel elevator down to the lounge for our photo shoot, Liz mentioned that in order to stay in shape, Cyrus exercises for at least two hours a day, to which Megan replied, “Honestly, I’d rather be fat.” </p>

	<p> Neither girl drinks, smokes or parties, but both admit cursing is their crutch. “We kind of have potty mouths. There are so many situations where I’m like, ‘Man, I wish I could drop a swear in that tweet,’ but that’s not classy,” Liz says. “We’re human beings, we’re 19-year-old girls, we drop swears. We’re not angels, you know? But no one is.” </p>

	<p> Megan and Liz behave this way, not just for the sake of their own images, but out of respect for their fans, who they genuinely love. The sheer volume of kind, encouraging messages both girls receive on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr is astounding. They do get a few negative messages and responses — a few hours before our interview Megan tweeted “i’m so tired my brain isn’t computing anything anymroe,” with the last word intentionally misspelled, and was slightly annoyed when a few followers corrected her — but the positive messages outweigh the negatives by far. </p>

	<p> Our fans are so funny and so nice,” Liz says. “I honestly sit there and laugh at their Twitter replies. They’re so creative.” “They are,” Megan says, in agreement. “They always put me in a good mood.”  </p>

	<p> The girls both attribute a great deal of their success to their fans. </p> 

	<p> “I feel like I never say ‘thank you’ enough,” Megan continues. “I wish I could literally write all of them a letter because they do so much for us. I hope they realize it, but I don’t think they realize how much they’ve changed our lives and how thankful I am.” </p>

	<p> <span class="letter"> I</span>t’s the power of Megan and Liz’s fans that’s propelling them to the next level. At the end of September they’re set to perform at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas, where they’ll open for Taylor Swift, Lil Wayne, Green Day and Rihanna among other major acts. </p>

	<p> Megan and Liz won a spot to perform at the Festival through the Macy’s iHeartRadio Rising Star competition, in which they beat out 25 other acts for the coveted opening spot. The winner was determined by fan votes, and Megan and Liz’s fans worked hard to make sure they won. </p> </div>

			<div class="caption"> “We want 15-year-olds and their moms to listen to our music, but we also want to sing songs that are relatable to 18 plus,” Liz says. </div>
			</div>

	<div class="text"> <p> The girls are “beyond stoked” for the Festival, especially to open for Taylor Swift, who has been their inspiration since before they started their YouTube channel. They met the country star in 2009 at her concert in Chicago after being introduced to her by Oprah Winfrey via Skype on The Oprah Winfrey Show. A fan had submitted Megan and Liz’s cover of Swift’s song “White Horse,” and Oprah liked it so much that she surprised the girls by introducing them to Swift on live television. </p>

	<p> Though Megan and Liz are in a different place professionally than they were three years ago, and they now call the video footage of themselves screaming and jumping up and down in their seats on Oprah “pretty embarrassing,” they’re still just as excited to meet her again at the iHeartRadio Festival, as any 19-year-old fans would be. </p>

	<p> “We’re hoping we get to meet her again because we want to be like ‘Hey, remember us? Look where we are now. We didn’t go away. You helped us get here,’” Liz says. </p>

	<p> The iHeartRadio Festival is also a big opportunity for Megan and Liz to make a name for themselves in mainstream music. Everything they are working on now revolves around the Festival. </p>

	<p> “It’s our chance to really make a career,” Liz says. “Right now, we’re not complaining at all. We have an awesome fan base and we have so many songs, but this is the chance to take it to a whole new level.” </p>

	<p> “We’re ready for it,” Megan adds. “It feels right.”</p>

	<p> <span class="letter-wide"> A</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s we begin to wrap our interview, talk to turns back to the Band Against Bullying show tomorrow.  </p>

	<p> “I’ve honestly never been more nervous for a show,” Liz says, rising from her seat on the floor. “Not for the performance part, but for the turn out.”  </p>

	<p> Even with a huge fan base and great prospects for the future in a difficult industry, Megan and Liz still fear that no one will show up to hear them sing. Before I leave the room, I hug both girls, wish them luck for tomorrow and tell them not to worry. </p>

	<p> They’re on their way. </p> </div>
