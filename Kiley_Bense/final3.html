By then the blue was nearly gone. I remember seeing the ring on her finger. She told me that it really belonged to my little brother, because his name was Brendan.</p>

  	<p>Seventy years ago, Brendan Hynes Halvey, my grandmother&#8217;s father, sat down at his desk in his house at 4850 Germantown Avenue, Philadelphia, PA to write a letter. &ldquo;My dear Helen&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and maybe then he stopped, and thought, or paused to consider the weight of that Tuesday and the one hundred heavy days that had gone before it. &ldquo;This morning I put Bob on a train at North Philadelphia to return to camp,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;and the memory of a like trip there, last July, to start another soldier on the first lap of a one-way journey, has had me &lsquo;down&#8217; all day.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Bob was Brendan&#8217;s oldest son, and the soldier who never came back was his youngest son and my grandmother&#8217;s little brother. Dick Halvey&mdash;the handsome kid who&#8217;d been a star basketball player at Roman Catholic High, who&#8217;d written his class&#8217;s <a href="#test-popup" class="open-popup-link"><img class="doc" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6526446/2923222/6ccb0ec4-d710-11e3-83fc-b8afd35a3c79.png" width="30">valedictorian speech</a>, who was all of 21 when he enlisted&mdash;that kid&mdash;was dead. One hundred days after Dick died in a hospital in North Africa, his father sent a letter to his sister Helen, and Bob got on a train in Philadelphia bound for camp.</p>

	I decided to go to Arlington Cemetery in July because of a photograph that was taken there in 1963: three boys with their parents and grandfather standing in a tight knot around a white gravestone. One of those kids is my dad, at 7, in knee socks and shorts and wedged between his parents, his head covered in that downy fuzz of little-boy buzzcuts, with ears like open shutters. It must&#8217;ve been summer, then, too. Taps were playing and my grandmother cried.

	<p><em><div class="drop">F</div>or months I have gone absolutely no place except Regent Street. I tried the Movies but the effect was not at all desirable. I know in the past I have been accused of many things by many people&mdash;not that the charges ever worried me&mdash;but only of late can anyone say that I am absolutely licked.</em></p>
<p>The metro platform at Arlington is crowded. People are wearing shirts emblazoned with eagles&#8217; heads and &ldquo;Don&#8217;t Tread on Me,&rdquo; wearing ball caps with Army logos and dangling flag-shaped keychains. There are also people in visors and flip-flops, holding maps and talking too loudly. The woman at the information desk says that it&#8217;ll be $8 to take a tram to section 34, and would I like an audio guide? </p>
<p><em>We know from <a href="#test-popup2" class="open-popup-link"><img class="doc" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6526446/2923222/6ccb0ec4-d710-11e3-83fc-b8afd35a3c79.png" width="30">Dick&#8217;s letters</a> he was under fire from the day before he landed until he died; we know he served Mass daily either at a base or in the field where instead of a cassock he was ordered to wear his knife and revolver, but through it all not a word of complaint, simply a reminder that someday we would all be together again.</em></p>
<p>Walking the two miles out to section 34 isn&#8217;t so bad: just take Eisenhower Drive to Bradley and turn at Pershing. It&#8217;s July in Virginia but mercifully it doesn&#8217;t feel like it. Clouds&mdash;the forecast said Evening Thunderstorms&mdash;linger, and the air is thick. The grass hums with what must be the sounds of thousands of mosquitos&#8217; wings. When I get to the crest of the hill where the World War II veterans lie, I have to pull out the scrap of paper again that I scribbled the number of the grave on: <a href="#test-popup3" class="open-popup-link"><img class="doc" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6526446/2923222/6ccb0ec4-d710-11e3-83fc-b8afd35a3c79.png" width="30">2162.</a></p>

<p><div class="drop">A</div>rlington is supposed to be a sanctuary, and out here, where the wind is hushed and the tourists don&#8217;t go, it does seem sacred. What&#8217;s not so hallowed are the numbers, the infinite numbers and their stones, so many rows that they touch the horizon. When 
I look at the rows, there&#8217;s only one word on my tongue: Why? There are many soldiers 
buried here whose lives weren&#8217;t stopped forever in the middle of a frame, who weren&#8217; t killed in battle. But there are far too many who were. One is too many. </p>

  <p><div class="drop">D</div>ick&#8217;s stone is midway up the hill, under the shade of a cherry tree in bloom. The tree&#8217;s roots have erupted around the stone next to his so that a whole corner of it is submerged under soil and knotted bark. What I wonder is this: how many years has it been since someone else stood here? How many since anyone came here for him? Since a girl sat on this grass and cried over him? Why didn&#8217;t I remember to bring flowers? Should I snap a branch from the tree and lay it where his head might be?</p>

  <p><em>I feel I have paid a big price these past months, and also realize that such things happen for the best. If I am to be called upon to give another in this great cause I hope God sends me strength enough to face it.</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe in heaven, or God. All those Sundays I spent in church as a kid, the Hail Marys I recited and the rosaries I counted: none of it meant anything to me. I don&#8217;t believe that my great-uncle knows that I visited him or that the deeds of the living matter to the dead. But I do believe that coming here was important, somehow. That when I walk down Spring Garden it is important to know that my grandmother grieved on this street, to remember that my great-grandfather was standing at the doorstep of number 5523 on a Saturday morning in April when he got a telegram that fell out of his hands.</p>

He never forgave the Jesuits for kicking him out, but he had enough pride in his Roman degree that he sent both his sons there. Enough pride that on his deathbed he chose his class ring as a parting gift to his only daughter Patricia, enough that on hers, she gave it to her daughter-in-law with the understanding that it would someday be worn by Brendan&#8217;s namesake, <a href="#test-popup6" class="open-popup-link"><img class="doc" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6526446/2923222/6ccb0ec4-d710-11e3-83fc-b8afd35a3c79.png" width="30">a little boy</a> who was born on Patricia&#8217;s birthday in 1994. </p>
