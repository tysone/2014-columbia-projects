 	<p><div class="drop">D</div>ismantled and forgotten by the thousands of commuters who pass through the cavern that took its place, the old Penn station seems gone forever. Attention to what remains of the old station has mostly revolved around the chunks of colonnade and fragments of sculpture that were scavenged both from the demolition site and trash yards. But pieces of the old actually survive within the new station, many of them visible to the public.</p></div>


   <div class="text">
   <p>In 1964, no one believed that Penn Station would be demolished until it actually happened. Protesters referred to it as &ldquo;our station&rdquo; and marched on the sidewalk in front of its towering columns. The station&#8217;s destruction triggered outrage and the beginnings of the historic preservation movement. The New York Times ran an article with the quote, &ldquo;We will probably be judged not by the monuments we build but by those we have destroyed.&rdquo; Its demise marks one of the great architectural tragedies of the twentieth century.</p></div>
 

   <div class="text">
   <p>The station was built in 1910 by the Pennsylvania Railroad as a homage to the age of trains. It was designed by the neoclassical architecture firm McKim, Meade and White (they also designed 30th Street Station in Philadelphia and the Columbia University campus in Morningside Heights). Penn Station was meant to recall a Roman monument: combining pink granite, glass and steel, McKim, Meade and White created a concourse that stretched upward and filled with light. Passengers could stand above the platforms and watch the trains arriving below.</p></div>
   
   <div class="text">
   <p>Today, an original entryway that was re-discovered in the 1990s when the station was renovated opens onto LIRR track entrances. In a wine and spirits shot, a slice of glass brick floor has been reappropriated as part of the ceiling. And the 22 stone eagles that once flanked the entrances have scattered across the country; two still guard the station.</p></div>

<p>On some of the Long Island Railroad track entrances, the old railings and staircases remain, supposedly because it was too expensive to remove them. The distinctive X pattern on the railing can be found in photos of the old station's concourse, and in other surviving buildings designed by McKim, like Columbia University.</p>

<p>An entrance in the lower level of the concourse is framed by an original entryway. Now painted red, it stands out from the building around it, if you know to look: it's covered in a detailed leaf design. The same design is visible in this photo of a candy store window display in the old station.</p>
