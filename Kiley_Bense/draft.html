<p><div class="drop">O</div>n a Friday night in Manhattan, a woman in an electric blue coat sits with a fiddle on her knee under fluorescent lights. Several round tables and plastic chairs are grouped around her and two other musicians. At a table near the front, Thomas Ihde and his two kids, 13-year-old Fiona and 10-year-old Liam, wait for the performance to start.&ldquo;They were worried there wouldn&#8217;t be children here,&rdquo; Ihde says, looking around at the crowd of mostly older people. &ldquo;They might have been right.&rdquo;</p></div>

 <p>The Ihdes are here, in a cafeteria-like space at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center, for a bilingual children&#8217;s theater production in English and Irish Gaelic (or Irish, as it&#8217;s usually called). Although the Ihdes are American, born and raised in New Jersey, all three speak Irish fluently, Fiona and Liam as native speakers. Liam fidgets with his iPhone as they wait for the play to begin.</p>


<p>The narrator bounds to the front of the makeshift stage. &ldquo;We&#8217;re going to do a show in Irish,&rdquo; he says to the audience. &ldquo;Not Irish as in How&#8217;s it going? How&#8217;s the craic? but actual Irish language.&rdquo; </p>

<p>(There are murmurs of sudden comprehension; earlier, a man at a nearby table examining the program squinted and said, &ldquo;Is that Irish?&rdquo;)
</p>

<p>The play recounts an old folk tale from Connemara, on the west coast of Ireland, written down by William Hamilton Maxwell in the 1830s. It is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hirgWpCeig"><em>The Blind Seal</em></a>. &ldquo;Over a century ago, a young seal was taken from Clew Bay,&rdquo; the narrator says, in Irish. &ldquo;He was domesticated by a gentleman who lived in a house by the shore.&rdquo; Each section of Irish narration is followed by the same story read in English. </p>

<p>As he is speaking, the theater company&#8217;s artist moves a canvas on stilts to the front of the space. The silver bracelet on his wrist, shaped like a feather, glints as he paints. The woman with the fiddle starts to play, and the tones of Irish folk music swell in the cafeteria. Ihde taps his foot.
</p>

<p> It soon becomes clear who speaks Irish and who doesn&#8217;t. During the Irish sections of narration, most of the audience members&#8217; eyes wander to the canvases. But the Ihdes watch both narrators: Thomas, with salt and pepper hair and dark eyebrows, Fiona, her purple glasses studded with tiny flowers and her jeans tucked into Ugg boots, and Liam, most interested of all, his hair hanging over his glasses. A faint smudge of blue and yellow paint is visible on his cheek.</p>

<p>The artist blots the sky with a sponge and dabs of white paint, and shades the tiny cottage on the edge of the shore with reds. Liam is riveted, leaning his head on his hand and staring at the painting of Connemara, his iPhone forgotten in his pocket.</p>




<div class="topgraf2">
<p><div class="drop">T</div>he Irish language has struggled for generations. From the 19th century onward, scholars, writers, outsiders and natives alike have predicted its demise with increasing certainty. An anonymous source delivered this dramatic prophecy in 1850:
</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;As to the Irish language, toleration and patronage have come too late, it cannot be saved alive by any human power, it is at present confined to about a third of the peasantry and those the most ignorant and uncivilized. As a spoken language it can hardly the survive the present generation, the fathers and mothers will retain it until their deaths but by the children it will be neglected and forgotten. The time for educating them in the Irish language has gone by forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Irish survives in 2014, but it is far from thriving. Despite ongoing revivalist efforts by the Irish government and others, it is still in decline as a native language. Less than 1 percent of the Irish population are native speakers, and only about 50,000 people in Ireland report using Irish in their daily lives outside of the classroom. The few Irish-speaking families left in Ireland mostly live along the edges of Ireland&#8217;s west coast, in areas known as the Gaeltacht.</p> 

<p>It&#8217;s possible that there will be no Irish-speaking communities left in Ireland within 50 years, according to experts like Lawrence Morris, a professor at Albright College in Pennsylvania who specializes in modern Irish language and medieval Irish literature. &ldquo;Once those areas are gone,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;it&#8217;s hard to say what will happen. It ceases to be a language of daily life.&rdquo; The shift currently underway is a natural process for a language in a minority position. Irish clings to life in a country where English is dominant in nearly every sphere. The grandchildren of the last monolingual speakers may speak Irish--it may even be their mother tongue--but for most of them, their English is stronger, easier and more frequently needed by the time they are teenagers, making it increasingly unlikely that they&#8217;ll raise their own children in Irish.</p> 

<p>The current extinction rate for languages is higher than the rate for mammals or birds, says Douglas Whalen, a linguist at the CUNY Graduate Center. &ldquo;It&#8217;s much more rapid in the past 100 years than it ever has been.&rdquo; A UNESCO report from 2010 said that half of the 6,700 languages extant today are in danger of dying before 2100. UNESCO&#8217;s Atlas of the world&#8217;s languages in danger currently lists Irish as &ldquo;definitely endangered&rdquo; meaning that children no longer learn the language at home. The rate of extinction in most places is driven by the swiftly moving forces of globalization and industrialization. Despite the occasional success story (Hebrew&#8217;s resurgence being the most prominent and most successful), reviving a language is very difficult. And there&#8217;s an argument to be made that if a language is no longer useful to its speakers, maybe it&#8217;s time to let it disappear.</p> 

<p>But for many people, language is a closely guarded emblem of identity. Not knowing the language of your culture seals you off from your peers and family members who do speak it. And language holds the key to much that defines Irishness-- to Irish poetry, literature and music. So much of art is untranslatable. Moreover, the Irish language is woven with Irish values. Saying hello, waving goodbye and signing off a letter in Irish all involve some form of &ldquo;May God Bless You.&rdquo; A commenter on an article about Irish on the website <em>Irish Central</em> put his feelings this way: &ldquo;When you lose your language, you lose your soul.&rdquo; This belief helps explain why the Irish state has been pouring resources into the task of saving Irish since 1922, the year of its founding.</p> 

<p>The reasons for the collapse of the language are tied to the centuries-long British occupation and Anglicization of Ireland. Over time, English became the language of government, business and upward mobility. Conversely, Irish was associated with everything that was the antithesis of civilization and modernity. The Great Famine of the 1840s dealt Irish a massive--though not yet fatal--blow. The people most affected by the potato famine, whose population was decimated by starvation and emigration, were Irish speakers. Irish immigrants to the United States brought the language with them (70,000 to 80,000 speakers are estimated to have once lived in New York alone in the 19th century, printing newspapers, teaching classes, and writing books in Irish) but for a constellation of reasons, these immigrants rarely passed the language on to their American-born children.</p>
 
<p>My great-great grandfather was one of those immigrants. Born in Kinvarra, County Galway in 1852, Timothy Halvey arrived in America in October 1866. According to his entry in the <em>History of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick</em> and newspaper clippings from the time, Halvey was an active supporter of the Irish language in his new country, founding schools in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and Buffalo, partnering with the Gaelic League (one of the first groups founded to revive the language), joining a number of Irish cultural organizations, and translating various texts and poems into Irish. And yet, for all his agitation, Halvey, a pale man with dark hair and a mustache, evidently failed to instill a love for the language in his children. His son Brendan, my great-grandfather, never spoke a word of Irish, or, at least, never admitted he could.</p>



<div class="topgraf2">
<p><div class="drop">T</div>homas Ihde&#8217;s maternal grandfather, whom he is named for, was also an immigrant from Galway and a native Irish speaker. Ihde tells a family story of his grandmother catching his grandfather and great-uncle chatting in Irish in the kitchen. &ldquo;She&#8217;d yell, &lsquo;Speak English! We&#8217;re in America!&#8217;&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Even if his grandmother had been supportive of the idea, there was little chance for the language to be passed down because Ihde&#8217;s grandfather died when his mother was only 3.</p>

<p>Despite this heritage and a deep interest in language (he speaks five languages fluently, including Irish, and holds a doctorate in linguistics), Ihde didn&#8217;t become curious about the language that would become his life&#8217;s work until he was in his twenties, teaching Hispanic students Spanish in Texas. He says that his epiphany came when he was encouraging his students to learn the language of their grandparents. &ldquo;One wise guy kid said to me, what was the language of your grandparents?&rdquo; he says. Ihde set about learning the language of his grandfather, a process that took about 10 years.</p>

<p>After achieving fluency, Ihde went on to write an Irish language textbook and edit a book about the language&#8217;s history and current state in the U.S. In 1989, he legally Gaelicized his name in Ireland to Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; h-&Iacute;de. Since 2000, Ihde has taught Irish at Lehman College in the Bronx, where he now oversees the Irish language program and is the chair of the Department of Languages and Literatures. Outside his office, maps of Ireland and mailboxes labeled with Irish names fill the walls. </p>

<p>By the time his children were born, Ihde was well equipped to raise them bilingually. He used what is known as the OPOL method (One Parent One Language), refusing to speak English to them for years. &ldquo;Up to the age of 5, if they spoke to me in English, I would say <em>Cad</em>? What?&rdquo; he says. He took them to the children&#8217;s Irish classes he used to teach in New York, where they were the stars of the class. As Fiona and Liam got older, Ihde wondered if there would be a backlash. &ldquo;I was waiting and waiting for the revolt against the language,&rdquo; he says. He&#8217;s still waiting.</p>

<p>Fiona Ihde says that her friends think that her bilingualism is cool, often asking her to speak Irish so they can marvel at her skills. &ldquo;Do you always perform?&rdquo; her dad asks when she brings this up. &ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; she says. Still, there are times when being an Irish speaker rubs up against well meaning American ignorance. At the Ihdes&#8217; school in New Jersey, they have a day where the teachers read a single book in as many different languages as possible. An ambitious teacher wanted to add Irish to the list; unfortunately, she didn&#8217;t speak Irish. She&#8217;d printed a Google Translate page from <em>The Cat in the Hat</em>. Liam (besides his sister) was the only student who could help her. He says he tried, but the translation was muddled with errors. The other languages were read without a problem, but when the teacher read the Irish page, other students asked Fiona and Liam, &ldquo;Oh, that&#8217;s Irish?&rdquo; Fiona makes a face. &ldquo;I was like, No, it&#8217;s not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then there is the issue of being &ldquo;more Irish than the Irish&rdquo; as Ihde put it in an essay he wrote on Irish-American identity in 2009. Liam tells a story about a girl he knows whose parents are both Irish immigrants. &ldquo;She said, &lsquo;I&#8217;m 100 percent Irish,&#8217;&rdquo; Liam says. &ldquo;But I said, &lsquo;But you don&#8217;t speak the language.&rdquo;&#8217; The girl was offended and upset.</p>

<p>For most of the Fiona and Liam&#8217;s childhood, they traveled to Ireland every summer, accompanying their father as he conducted research. Because of this, Fiona has a few Irish-speaking friends in Ireland. She talks to them on Skype and Facebook, playing games and watching soccer matches while video-chatting in Irish. The Ihdes also attend the Irish language immersion weekends hosted by Dalta&iacute; na Gaeilge, an Irish language teaching organization in the Northeast. There aren&#8217;t usually many children there, but it&#8217;s a rare chance to spend a whole three days speaking only Irish. This year, Fiona plans to attend the weeklong summer retreat by herself.</p>

<div class="topgraf2">
<p><div class="drop">P</div>arents in the United States who have chosen to raise their children in Irish are part of a scattered movement to preserve Irish in the place where the true future of any language lies: the home.</p></div>

<p>It&#8217;s enough of a challenge to raise Irish-speaking children in Ireland, where there are Irish language schools, television shows, and community centers, and the language has a strong public profile. There&#8217;s also a government-sponsored Family Language Program designed specifically to support parents raising children in Irish. In the United States, none of this infrastructure exists. Americans&#8217; reactions to Irish speakers in their midst range from bewildered to hostile. Many Americans have never heard of Irish, let alone heard it being spoken in a grocery store or taxi cab. MaryKate Guidry, a 22-year-old with auburn bangs and a taste for stylish gold jewelry, was raised bilingual in New Jersey. Her father, Liam Guidry, is a leader of Dalta&iacute; na Gaeilge. She says her friends still make fun of her for speaking Irish. &ldquo;They&#8217;ll say, &lsquo;Are you speaking alien? Are you speaking elvish?&#8217;&rdquo; In kindergarten, Guidry assumed that everyone spoke the language of their heritage. When she tried to speak Irish to a boy in her class with an Irish name, she learned otherwise. &ldquo;He looked at me like I was actually insane. It was absolutely heartbreaking,&rdquo; she says. Despite this, when asked if she&#8217;d raise her own kids in Irish if she had them, she doesn&#8217;t hesitate. &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>


<p>Irish-speaking children in the U.S. face similar challenges as other children growing up bilingual in a (mostly) monoglot society: it&#8217;s something that sets them apart, marking them as different from their peers. Yet speaking an endangered language carries burdens that don&#8217;t come with languages like French or Mandarin, which have legions of native speakers and mountains of easily accessible television shows, books, and movies.</p>


<p>Having no other native speakers nearby means that kids are dependent on their Irish-speaking parents for all vocabulary, syntax, and grammar. The internet has helped to solve this problem. Kevin Donovan, a high school teacher in Virginia, says his four-year-old son is  only allowed to watch Irish television. While he&#8217;s watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-cDICFP_ZQ">Dora the Explorer</a> he&#8217;s learning new words and improving his accent, filling in gaps in his father&#8217;s vocabulary. 
</p>

<p>None of the parents I encountered were native speakers themselves; many did not achieve fluency until adulthood. Surprisingly, most are Americans, two or three generations removed from Ireland&#8217;s shores. Carrying out the daily business of living in a language that is not your first is no easy feat. So why do it? Kevin Donovan&#8217;s reasons for raising his children in Irish start with simple mathematics. &ldquo;If I have one kid who can speak Irish, then I would double the number of speakers in my immediate vicinity. If everyone who knows Irish taught another person, we&#8217;d have a few million speakers.&rdquo; It goes deeper than that, of course. &ldquo;It&#8217;s part of their heritage,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I want them to have access to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lawrence Morris, the professor at Albright College, is also the father of four bilingual children. He says that raising his children bilingual seemed a natural thing to do, and given the state of the language, an important thing, too. &ldquo;It seemed almost unethical not to raise them in Irish,&rdquo; he says. He is fluent enough to pass the language on. It would be a disservice to his heritage not to try.</p>

<div class="topgraf2">
<p><div class="drop">T</div>he play tells the story of a farmer who lives in Connemara. For four years, the farmer has kept a pet seal who lives in his home and sleeps in the oven. When a blight strikes his cattle, the farmer calls on a crone for advice. She tells him that the seal is the cause of the disease and must leave the home. The farmer complies, but a week later, in the midst of a storm, the servants find that the seal has returned for a last time, and is lying &ldquo;dead on the doorstep.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p> With the seal&#8217;s death, more calamity falls on the farmer and his family. All of his children die. His cattle continue to perish. Soon, all that is left of his farm and fortune is a ruin.</p>

<p> During the narration, the artist paints more canvases. At the end, he paints over the canvases, now lined up edge to edge, connecting them into one single work. The dark lines start to form a body, tail and head. The hag from the story becomes a flipper. Liam turns to Thomas urgently. &ldquo;Dad, it&#8217;s the seal!&rdquo; he mouths. The artist adds four words in Irish in black paint to the canvases before stepping away: <em>&Eacute;ist le do Chro&iacute;!</em> Listen to your heart!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&#8217;t think it would be so sad,&rdquo; Fiona says, as applause fills the room. &ldquo;It wasn&#8217;t very American,&rdquo; Ihde says, referring to Americans&#8217; love for happy endings. &ldquo;There was a lesson to be learned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Ireland, there are many tales and superstitions about seals, which Ihde says are thought to embody the spirits of past generations. The stories mostly revolve around selkies—creatures, half human and half seal, who emerge from the sea every seven years, or sooner if they are summoned by a woman&#8217;s seven tears. &ldquo;It&#8217;s very bad luck to hurt a seal,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Children in Ireland watching this would know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liam and Fiona pose with their father for a photo in front of the seal. During the play, a few other families with children trickled in, although in a crowd of about 40, there are still no more than five or six kids in attendance. One is a family that the Ihdes recognize, a father with three Irish-speaking daughters who works at the Irish Consulate in New York. Fiona is friends with the oldest girl, but she isn&#8217;t here tonight.</p>

<p>Ihde stops to talk to the father as his daughters race around the room. He says later that diplomats often hire tutors to coach their children in Irish while they live in America, so that when the family returns to Ireland they won&#8217;t be behind in school.</p>

<p>As the crowd shuffles to the front of the room to examine the paintings and talk to the musicians, a woman in a purple dress who introduces herself as Margaret comes up to the Ihdes and starts talking to Ihde in Irish. She is accompanied by her husband and her sons, twins, one in a T-shirt and the other in a suit jacket and tie, both wearing matching plastic glasses. Margaret&#8217;s Irish is, oddly, dotted with Spanish words, but she carries on a conversation with Thomas and his children for a while. (There&#8217;s an Irish saying: <em>Is fearr Gaeilge briste, n&aacute; Bearla cl&iacute;ste.</em> Broken Irish is better than clever English.) 
</p>

<p>Then she turns to her sons and says, in a stage whisper, &ldquo;Boys, I know you don&#8217;t understand what I&#8217;m saying, but it&#8217;s all nice things.&rdquo; Her husband and children do not speak any Irish, beyond a few phrases.</p>

<p>Margaret and the man who works at the Consulate are a reminder that the Ihdes are in a special kind of space tonight, one they don&#8217;t often encounter in New York, or in the United States for that matter. This is a room where people around them can understand what they&#8217;re saying. &ldquo;You get used to the fact that no one can understand you,&rdquo; Ihde says. Not that they use Irish exclusively to gossip, but there are certain private conversations you probably wouldn&#8217;t carry out in an elevator with strangers eagerly leaning in, unless you were sure they had no idea what you were saying. &ldquo;When we go to Ireland, I have to remind them,&rdquo; Ihde says. And yet, it&#8217;s telling that even here, at a play conducted half in Irish, most of the attendees can only speak English, their Irish limited to <em>sl&aacute;inte</em> and <em>&Eacute;irinn go Br&aacute;ch</em>.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a special bond that comes from having such a rare skill and owning the pathway to communication with such a small group. At the play, the people who the Ihdes talk to instantly warm to them when they learn that the Ihdes are fluent speakers. It&#8217;s obvious, too, that Thomas Ihde is proud of his children&#8217;s language; it&#8217;s visible in his face every time he tells another stranger that yes, they do speak Irish. As the Ihdes move toward the exit to leave, they stop to chat with Dara McGee, the theater company&#8217;s painter. Ihde pats Liam on the shoulder, explaining to McGee about Liam&#8217;s love of art. Liam looks sheepish, but he talks to McGee in Irish. Leaving the cafeteria in search of the bathrooms, Liam is smiling.</p>


<div class="topgraf2">
<p><div class="drop">W</div>hy do Irish-Americans abandon Irish culture?&rdquo; Brian O&#8217;Broin asked me, pointedly. Besides being the father of trilingual daughters (they speak German, too) O&#8217;Broin is a professor of Irish language and literature at William Paterson University in New Jersey. From O&#8217;Broin&#8217;s perspective, the only artifacts of their culture Irish-Americans retain over generations are their names and their Catholicism. </p></div>

<p>O&#8217;Broin&#8217;s question took me aback. I&#8217;ve always considered myself Irish-American, and proud of it, but all I really have to show for that pride is a head of red hair, blue eyes, and a jewelry box full of rosaries. My mother cooks corned beef and cabbage on St. Patrick&#8217;s Day; my brother&#8217;s name is Brendan and my dad&#8217;s is Michael John Patrick; I have memories of my grandfather singing &ldquo;Danny Boy&rdquo; and &ldquo;When Irish Eyes Are Smiling&rdquo; to me, sitting on his knee. And yet, these are just vestiges, Americanized echoes of a richer tradition that must have landed in Philadelphia with Timothy Halvey in 1866 and has since been swallowed up.</p>

<p>Some 36 million Americans claim Irish ancestry, according to the 2008 census. Twenty-two thousand reported that they spoke Irish Gaelic in a 2006 census survey. Because these numbers are self-reported, they are somewhat suspect. Ireland&#8217;s self-reported census numbers, for example, have painted a far too rosy picture of the language&#8217;s prospects for years, according to O&#8217;Broin. Many in Ireland exaggerate their abilities or their usage out of embarrassment, pride or both.</p>

<p>But America&#8217;s deep pool of potential supporters, more than eight times the population of Ireland, is one of the reasons the Irish government spends so much money promoting the language here: funding university departments and classes, sending Fulbright scholars to teach Irish in Montana, Pennsylvania and New York, and bringing American students to the Gaeltacht to learn Irish in immersion. In the 2012-2013 academic year, the government sent nearly $650,000 to American universities to help fund the study of the Irish language. The idea is to boost Irish to an equal footing with other European languages, which are widely taught in higher education around the world.</p>

<p>Although some Irish-Americans have lost the more tangible touchstones of their roots, they remain interested in and loyal to Irish culture to an astonishing degree. How else to explain the thousands of Irish cultural clubs, music and dance groups, language societies and pubs across the states? There are Irish language immersion weekends in Tennessee, Indiana and Wisconsin. Although the growth of the suburbs has fractured the Irish neighborhoods of the Northeast, Philadelphia, Boston and New York remain centers of Irish culture, containing Irish book clubs and radio broadcasts.</p>

<p>Saoirse N&iacute; Fhearghaile, an Irish-American who is raising her three-year-old son in Irish in Massachusetts, believes that Irishness is more persistent than it might seem. Irish-Americans get shamrock tattoos, celebrate St. Patrick&#8217;s Day, trace their genealogies, and, above all, retain a devotion to hospitality and family. &ldquo;It&#8217;s a strong culture,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;If nothing else, the longing for it dies hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In New Jersey, a small band of people have been meeting in the chapel at St. Peter&#8217;s University for more than 25 years. Most do not live in Jersey City or even in the tri-state area. But they are drawn to the mass given there one Sunday a month because it is said in Irish.</p>

<p>The chapel is modest, with only the minimum decor required of a Catholic church (a crucifix set against gold tiles, a row of stained glass windows, statues of Mary and Joseph positioned around the nave). On a Sunday morning in February, a congregation of 11 rises from the rows of wooden chairs and files into a line to receive Communion. A CD of Irish hymns plays from a boombox by the right wall. Thomas Ihde sits in a chair near the front.</p>

<p>To hear the rhythms of mass in Irish is a disconcerting experience if you&#8217;ve only ever heard mass in English. There must have been a distant time in Ireland when Catholic prayers were said in Irish, when the Our Father was known as &aacute;r nAthair and the Apostles&#8217; Creed began:</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3x3uRV55EM"><em>Creidim in aon Dia amh&aacute;in, </br>
an tAthair uilechumhachtach, </br>
a rinne neamh agus talamh </br>
agus an uile n&iacute; sofheicthe agus dofheicthe.</em></a>
</p>

<p>When the mass is over, the congregants gather in a back room in the adjoining building to eat snacks and chat. My entrance into the room is a clear example of code-switching: nearly as soon I walk in and open my mouth, the sounds of Irish conversation disappear, replaced instantly with English. Code-switching is a linguistic term referring to bilingual people switching between languages in the course of a single conversation. This is a subject Ihde touched on when he was explaining how best to approach meeting Fiona and Liam: &ldquo;One aspect common among Irish speakers is that when English speakers enter the room, Irish speakers usually switch to English,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;This reality is common when you have two languages of differing status level...Unfortunately that mindset continues as much as I try to break it.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="topgraf2">
<p><div class="drop">O</div>n February 15, 2014, the week before the mass, some 10,000 people took to the streets of Dublin in protest. The protesters weren&#8217;t demonstrating against the stagnant unemployment rate or the stubborn recession. They were angry about what they view as the government&#8217;s mishandling of the fight to save the Irish language. Many marched with red tape stretched over their mouths, two pieces crossed to form a sea of bright Xs.</p></div>

<p> In December, Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in, the Irish language commissioner, had announced he would resign, saying that he couldn&#8217;t continue to work for a government that was failing to meet the standards set in its own laws. The government had pledged to deliver services in the Gaeltacht in Irish, but it is far short of meeting this goal.</p>

<p>Why is the language revival movement still struggling? By some measures, it isn&#8217;t: most people who are educated in Ireland can at least carry on a basic conversation in Irish. Irish is a required class in all public primary and secondary schools. There is Irish language television, radio and theater. There are a growing number of Irish medium schools, where all classes are taught in Irish, starting in kindergarten. (One of those schools recently achieved minor YouTube fame with a video of the students performing Anna Kendrick&#8217;s hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz63M3v11nE">&ldquo;When I&#8217;m Gone&rdquo;</a> in Irish. Fiona Ihde likes sharing music videos with friends who don&#8217;t speak Irish, who are often surprised that there are pop songs sung in Irish.) But all of this institutional support hasn&#8217;t increased the pool of native speakers or saved Irish-speaking towns.</p>

<p>According to O&#8217;Broin and other experts, the failures of the revival are due largely to the fact that the government has promoted Irish as a second language and a classroom language first and foremost. Forcing children to learn a language in school rarely leads to fluency, and often has the unintended consequence of teaching students to view the language as a chore.</p>

<p>And yet this month&#8217;s protest represents a sign of change. Many of the protesters were young people. There are clubs in Dublin where you can only speak Irish. Could Irish be shaking free of the old prejudices that have shackled it for centuries? Has it become cool to know Irish? What can&#8217;t be answered yet is how this shift, if there is one, will translate in private life. To make a comeback, Irish needs to reclaim not just the corner office and the classroom, but the pub and the dinner table and the church.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molded and shaped in that island, it is the major historical expression of the Irish people. In the language are reflected Irish skies, Irish water, Irish forests that no longer stand. Could it be that there is something in us that, despite the years, despite the miles, will be satisfied with nothing less than this speech?&rdquo; This was written by a contributor to Thomas Ihde&#8217;s book <em>The Irish Language in the United States</em> from 1990, struggling to come to terms with the dedication of those who became fluent in Irish despite its ever-smaller number of speakers. Brian O&#8217;Broin has a realist&#8217;s view of the language&#8217;s future. But even an academic can be prone to optimism. &ldquo;When all is said and done, I would not be raising my kids in Irish if I didn&#8217;t think there was a lot of hope,&rdquo; he says.</p>

<p>At 13, Fiona Ihde is already planning a future defined and driven by her Irish language skills. She wants to be a teacher when she grows up, or, as she put it, &ldquo;I think I want to be a teacher like this old guy,&rdquo; patting her dad&#8217;s shoulder. &ldquo;It looks easyish.&rdquo; She plans to go to university in Galway, to study Irish, and to teach it in Ireland.</p>

<p>Thomas Ihde smiles at her. &ldquo;There&#8217;s great demand for high school teachers there,&rdquo; he says.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&#8217;t get paid-&rdquo; Fiona begins, but her dad cuts in. &ldquo;You don&#8217;t do it for the money.&rdquo;</p>
