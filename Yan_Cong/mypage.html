			<p>I met Roshard Henderson during the city's homeless outreach population survey. The 31-year-old told the survey volunteer, "I want a bed, but I don't want to go back to Randall's Island.</p>
			<p> He spent two nights on Randall's Island about two months ago, before he decided to leave. "They weren't really treating me right. I felt like in a jail," he said. "It wasn't the place was as bad, it's just the people&hellip; People who work there thought I'm just another man in the shelter, a statistics."</p>
			<p>Originally from Douglesville, Georgia, Henderson is homeless and jobless now. He is on the waiting list for transitional housing. He's been waiting for a year and a half.</p>
			<p>He spends most of his nights on a train. "It's warmer. And nobody bothers you if you know how to handle yourself and conduct yourself. You sit there, get your head on the corner, they'll just let you ride," he said. "I can sleep all the way to 12pm in the afternoon."</p>

		<h4>Joseph</h4>

		<p>It was 17 degree on the afternoon of Jan. 3, 2014, after the snowstorm hit New York City. Joseph, 57, stood outside Penn Station holding his sign and begging money from people walking in and out of the station. It was one of the coldest days this winter, but for Joseph, it was just another day in the cold.</p>
		<p>He woke up in Union Square under blankets and plastic bags in the morning, hid his stuff in the park and made his way to Penn Station. He got there around 3 p.m., and got about $10 till 5 p.m., which he said was not bad.</p>
		<p>He used to be a crane operator, but got laid-off due to the economy depression. He lost his home in Howard Beach in Hurricane Sandy. He had no family to turn for help.</p>
		<p>Joseph said, "I couldn't get along with my siblings. After my parents passed years ago, they were after the money they left. I wasn't interested in that kind of thing."</p>

		<h4>"Tyron"</h4>

		<p>After a cup of soup and a sandwich, he still felt hungry. He went back to the soup kitchen volunteers who were distributing food on 9th Avenue, only to find empty baskets and carts. He could do nothing but to accept the fact that the food were all gone.</p>
<p>He went back to Port Authority, where he stays day and night. He's homeless.</p>
<p>Outside Port Authority, he slowed down and picked up some cigarette butts from the ground. I asked him what are those for. He said, "I smoke them."</p>
<p>He asked me not to publish his real name, and made up a fake name, Tyron. He also doesn't want himself photographed. "Because I don't look good."</p>
<p>He's 43, from Rochester, NY. He usually sits somewhere in Port Authority and solicits money from passers-by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I say, 'god bless you sir, god bless you ma'am.' Sometimes I beg, 'please, give me some money ma'am'. Sometimes I'm mad at some people, I'll get nasty. I'll go, 'f*** you'."</p>
<p>"Here is the catch-22 for me," he went on. "When I say 'god bless you', people don't give me that much. But when I beg, they stop and give me money. Some days when I beg people, I get more than $25."</p>
<p>For him, $25 for a day is a lot. He even did the calculation for me. "25 times 30, that's $750 a month. But I don't get $25 every day."</p>
<p>I asked him what he say to people the most.</p>
<p>He said it's "God bless you."</p>
<p>"Then you get less money," I asked.</p>
<p>He responded,"But my heart is at peace now."</p>

		<p >I visited the soup kitchen at St. Thomas Church on 5th Avenue and 53rd Street in December, 2013. The church's soup kitchen prepares food for people in need every Saturday, and distributes lunch bags in the street.</p>
<p >A volunteer at the soup kitchen called Danny told me, the soup kitchen started their mission since&nbsp;1984, and has never missed a single Saturday yet. Not even last year when Hurricane Sandy hit the city.</p>
<p >The volunteers at the soup kitchen prepared 315 lunch bags, and they went as far as 72nd Street and Columbus Avenue to give the lunch bags to those who were in need of a cup of warm soup.</p>

	<h4>Homeless Memorial Day Service</h4>

		<p>About 50 people joined a memorial service in Harlem to remember homeless people who died in the past year in New York City on the afternoon of Dec. 21, 2013, the winter solstice and the longest night of the year.</p><p>
More than 50 names of people who died without a home were handwritten on a piece of paper on the wall of a room in New Song Church in Harlem, where the memorial took place.</p>
<p>"We are not numbers, we are persons," said Anthony Williams, the coordinator of the memorial service, in the opening speech.
The memorial service not only aimed to remember those people, but also to raise the awareness of the health impact of homelessness.
Life expectancy for chronically homeless people is around 45 years, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, whereas the life expectancy for New Yorkers has increased to almost 81 years in 2013.</p>
<p>"We are talking about 30 or even 40 years of needlessly lost life because of homelessness. If we begin to put resources not into shelters, but into subsidy for people moving from shelter to real housing, we can prevent a lot of homelessness, and eventually end homelessness."</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>More than 3,000 homeless people are unsheltered in New York City, according to the <a href="https://a071-hope.nyc.gov/hope/statistics.aspx">Homeless Outreach Population Estimate</a> conducted by the city's homeless services department in 2013. For various reasons, these people chose to stay in the cold when they don't have a place to call home.</p>
<p>This project aim to tell those people's story, and raise awareness of chronic homelessness issues.</p>
