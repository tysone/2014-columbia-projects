 <div class="text"><p>NYPD's License Division is in charge of processing applications and assigning the appropriate permits to those who qualify to own a firearm. For those who seek aid in completing the application process, gun license consulting firms have formed that specialize in NYC permit regulation. The NYPD’s website warns people that consulting firms will not aid, expedite, or guarantee their application for a permit. And it makes clear that only licensed attorneys may represent someone before police’s License Division. A responding officer with the Office of the Deputy Commissioner’s Public Information unit said that the police department does not gather data on how many applicants for gun licenses are using the services of a consultant, nor do they gather information on how many people are represented by an attorney during their application process. The department has not released informaiton on how many have applied for firearm licenses; however, the NYPD presents their revenue from licesning to city council every year. A handgun license application, which is valid for three years, is $340 plus $92.50 for fingerprinting, totaling to $431.50.The figures below show the revenue generated from application fees, not counting the fingerprinting fee. </p>

Long gun permits bring in significantly less funds because the application $200 is less than the handgun permit. Looking at the revenue and cost of an application, here are how many applications are submitted every year to the license division. The approximations don't take into account how many of the applications are denied, and the cost to renew a license is the same as to apply for one.

Consultants say they can review an application for accuracy, but they also say that they screen potential clients before agreeing to work with them taking on only those likely to have their application approved. "To have to hire an attorney to exercise your constitutional right is absolutely absurd," says King, President of the NYSRPA.  The application process for a pistol permit takes about six months and  an applicant will have visited the police headquarters in lower Manhattan at least four times throughout this process.</p>

 <p>The first visit is required for filing an application and being fingerprinted. After an officer is assigned, the applicant must return for a one-on-one interview with the license division investigator. Applicants are asked questions that test their knowledge of safety regulations and evaluate any queries that rise from their background check. There are several documents that applicants are required to bring to the interview, including a notarized letter from a spouse, partner, or guardian testifying that they are aware of you applying for a license and they must state whether they object to the weapon in your home. Another form is needed specifying how you’ll maintain your firearms and who its “safeguard” will be in the case that you should die or become disabled. If approved for the license, you must go in person for the third time to pick up the license and purchase authorization. Then after you’ve purchased your first firearm, you return for the fourth and final time to have the firearm inspected and its serial number noted. </p>

<p>One of the consultants in New York City, Michael Marten. His website's domain name expired in January of this year, but prior to that he described himself as a former employee of the License Division who had worked there for about eight years as a supervising lieutenant. His website advised: " I am uniquely able to assist you with this endeavor, which can often be intimidating." Marten says he began helping people with the licensing process after a friend sought his help for upgrading his home premises permit to a carry and conceal. For about five years Marten has worked on his own with people who find him through personal referrals. He’s not affiliated with any gun range, and he says he’s not a member of the NRA. But for $300 he says he helps people by professionally putting together their application and guides them through the process. 
The majority of Marten's clients are seeking a gun permit in order to work in armed security. Obtaining the permit, in their eyes, is a qualification that better equips them for a higher paying career. </p>



Arnold Wachtel is another NYC specialized consultant who works for Advanced Protection 
Consultants LLC. Their consulting firm is affiliated with the only gun range in Manhattan, a 
basement level shooting range in downtown Manhattan. He says the firm has had a near 100 
percent success rate since 1989, and that its most typical clients are those seeking a personal self-defense firearm in their home and those applying for a business premises or carry license. Help from the firm begins at $495 and increases depending on the complexity and type of application.

Another consulting firm is Edelman’s Pistol Permit Service. Bob Ishkanian, one of their consultants, says they’ve been operating for about 35 years. According to him, Edelman’s helps about 75 clients a week from New York City, Nassau county, Suffolk county, upstate New York, and Connecticut. They compare their services to that of the experts of H&R Block who, for a fee, prepare civilian tax forms to ensure their professional completion. Without revealing specifics, Iskanian says fees vary from a couple hundred to a couple thousand dollars, and the firm makes about $5,000 a week. Ishkanian’s position is that the NYPD’s license division has become antagonistic, set on intimidating civilians away from attempting the permit process and denying anyone they can from licensed firearm ownership. Michael Marten, who oversaw investigating officers of the division, says they treats the agency treats every case like a checklist, without arbitrary judgments.
<br> 
<br>
“The investigators come in with no love or hate for guns or the people applying,” says Marten. 

But if an applicant is denied for an application and desires to appeal, there is an avenue
they can pursue to challenge the division’s decision. They can file an article 78 complaint.

The attorney in NYC with the most experience and whom is most well-known by the gun licensing division is John Skylar Chambers. Chambers has been filing suits to challenge license decisions since 1991, and is well experienced with the entire licensing process. Chambers can be found under court records having represented people in 223 Article 78 cases. Article 78 is the statute of law that allows for the legal challenging of an agency’s decision, in this case the decision whether or not someone deserves to own a firearm. Chambers says his work is recognized by the Supreme Court justices and has even had soon-to-be NYC police commissioner, Bill Bratton, refer him. But one of his most high-profile clients says he wouldn't recommend him.

 Daniel Wisotsky is the head of security for the Rockefeller family, in charge of securing their private home in Manhattan, the financial offices at 30 Rockefeller Plaza and the personal security for David Rockefeller. The 51-year-old is a former marine. During five of his 22 years of service he was a tactical weapons handler. There was an incident and Wisotsky was found outside his home with his firearm, something that's prohibited for people with a premises license. His permit was suspended, and when he applied for another years later he did not mention at one point he'd had assault charges and orders of protection brought against him. Even though the charges were dropped, the license division demands complete honesty from applicants, and his permit was denied. Wisotsky says he paid Chambers $5,000 to file an article 78 case against the license division, but it was unsuccessful.
