				Nicholas Heyward Sr. says people in the community used to refer to this particular officer as <em>Robocop</em>. The officer had his firearm out when he entered the stairwell and mistook the toy gun in 13-year-old Nicholas Jr.'s hand for a real one.

<p><span style= "font-family: Georgia" "width:960px" "font-size: 25px">The NYPD patrol guide does not specifically detail any protocals for unholserting a firearm. During depositions the officer said the stairwell was dimly lit, and that he heard clicking noises resembling the sound of a gun misfiring.
 In 1994 the city's newest recruits were all taking part in Operation Impact, an NYPD program that sent rookie cops into negihborhoods with some of the highest crime rates.
