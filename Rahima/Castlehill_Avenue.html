<p><b>By 4pm, Javone Rodriguez had downed two $5 “Armageddons”,</b> one “Around the world” and a $3 wheat grass shot.</p>
<p>Rodriguez 27, a soft-spoken media tech student with braided hair has been coming to Juices for Life, a juice bar that churns out cold-pressed juices, smoothies and healthy concoctions since it opened in 2011. The Around the World, a tonic drink infused with fermented herbs is a favorite of his.
Before this, Rodriguez had to travel to Harlem, a one-hour commute to get his juice fix, a treat he valued as a vegetarian conscious about what enters his body.</p>
<p>Javone and his fellow patrons are proof that juicing, a lifestyle found more often among rich vegan women, is for everyone.</p>

<p><b>Opening a juice bar on Castle Hill Avenue</b> was a radical idea when it was first initiated by famous Bronx rapper Styles P, Trinidadian-born juicing expert Nigel Rollocks and Leo Galvez a local entrepreneur, in 2011 when the food culture of the neighborhood was dominated by chicken gyro’s and grilled cheese sandwiches.</p>
