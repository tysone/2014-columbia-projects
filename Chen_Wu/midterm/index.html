As an American cultural icon, the building's name is derived from New York's nickname. </div>

            Designed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Lamb" target="_blank">William F.Lamb</a>, and the site was first developed as the John Thompson Farm in the late 18th century. On January 22, 1930, the site was excavated  and on March 17, the construction of the building started. 
            <br></br>
            The constrction involved 3,400 workers, mostly immigrants from Europe. According to offcial accounts, five workers died during the construction and it cost 40,948,900 to build the building. </div>

            With 6,500 windows and 73 elevators, it was the first building to have more than 100 floors. The building houses 1,000 businesses and as of 2007, approximately 21,000 employees work there each day.</div>

        The building's opening coincided with the Great Depression in the United States, and as a result much of its office space was initially unrented. The building's vacancy was exacerbated by its poor location on 34th Street, which placed it relatively far from public transportation, as Grand Central Terminal and Penn Station were (and are) several blocks away, as is the more-recently built Port Authority Bus Terminal. Other more successful skyscrapers, such as the Chrysler Building, did not have this problem. 
        <br></br>
        In its first year of operation, the observation deck took in approximately 2 million dollars, as much money as its owners made in rent that year. The lack of renters led New Yorkers to deride the building as the "Empty State Building".The building would not become profitable until 1950. The famous 1951 sale of the Empire State Building to Roger L. Stevens and his business partners was brokered by the prominent upper Manhattan real-estate firm Charles F. Noyes &amp; Company for a record $51 million. At the time, that was the highest price paid for a single structure in real-estate history. --- Wikipedia</div>

        Over the years, more than thirty people have attempted suicide, most successfully, by jumping from the upper parts of the building. The first suicide occurred even before its completion, by a worker who had been laid off.The fence around the observatory terrace was put up in 1947 after five people tried to jump during a three-week span.--- Wikipedia</div>

        Two major shooting incidents have occurred at or in front of the Empire State Building.On February 24, 1997, a gunman shot seven people on the observation deck, killing one, then fatally wounded himself.
        <br></br>
        On August 24, 2012 at about 9 am EDT, on the sidewalk at the Fifth Avenue side of the building, a gunman shot and killed a former co-worker from a workplace that had laid him off in 2011. When two police officers confronted the gunman, 58-year-old Jeffrey T. Johnson, he aimed his firearm at them. They responded by firing 16 shots at Johnson, killing him but also wounding nine bystanders, most of whom were hit by fragments, although three took direct hits from stray bullets.--- Wikipedia</div>

        The Empire State Building has one of the most popular outdoor observatories in the world, having been visited by over 110 million people. The 86th-floor observation deck offers impressive 360-degree views of the city. There is a second observation deck on the 102nd floor that is open to the public. It was closed in 1999, but reopened in November 2005. It is completely enclosed and much smaller than the first one; it may be closed on high-traffic days. Tourists may pay to visit the observation deck on the 86th floor and an additional amount for the 102nd floor.
        <br></br>
        The lines to enter the observation decks, according to Concierge.com, are "as legendary as the building itself:" there are five of them: the sidewalk line, the lobby elevator line, the ticket purchase line, the second elevator line, and the line to get off the elevator and onto the observation deck. For an extra fee tourists can skip to the front of the line. The Empire State Building makes more money from tickets sales for its observation decks that it does from renting office space. --- Wikipedia</div>

        According to Wikipedia, New York City is the largest media market in the United States. Since the September 11 attacks, nearly all of the city's commercial broadcast stations (both television and FM radio) have transmitted from the top of the Empire State Building. 
        <br></br>
        Antennae for broadcast stations are located at the top of the Empire State Building. Broadcasting began at the Empire State Building on December 22, 1931, when RCA began transmitting experimental television broadcasts from a small antenna erected atop the spire.

            ince 1931, the Empire State Building has been an international icon and has been immortalized on the Silver Screen as a timeless classic for not only New York, but the world. As a hot destination for Hollywood, filmmakers have featured the building in more than 250 feature films to tell their tales. Some of the most memorable Empire State Building moments can be seen in "King Kong," "An Affair to Remember," "Sleepless in Seattle," "Elf," and "Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief." ---<a href="http://www.esbnyc.com/esb_story_movies.asp" target="_blank">The Offcial Site of the Emipre State Building</a>

            ccording to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_Building" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, in 1964, floodlights were added to illuminate the top of the building at night, in colors chosen to match seasonal and other events, such as St. Patrick's Day, Christmas and Independence Day. </p>

            On November 6, 2012, CNN used the top of the Empire State Building as a scoreboard for the United States presidential election. When Barack Obama reached 270 electoral votes, which meant that he won the election, the lights turned blue. 20 days later, the building had its first ever synchronized light show, using Alicia Keys' music.

            Traditionally, the building will lit New York's sports teams' color on the nights when they have home games. It is also illuminated in tennis-ball yellow during US Open in late August and early September. A week before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLVIII" target="_blank">Super Bowl XLVIII</a>, the building was lit according to the amounts of Twitter hashtags, either green and navy blue of the Seattle Seahawks or orange and blue of the Denver Broncos.
