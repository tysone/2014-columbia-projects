            ccording to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_Building" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, in 1964, floodlights were added to illuminate the top of the building at night, in colors chosen to match seasonal and other events, such as St. Patrick's Day, Christmas and Independence Day. </p>

            On November 6, 2012, CNN used the top of the Empire State Building as a scoreboard for the United States presidential election. When Barack Obama reached 270 electoral votes, which meant that he won the election, the lights turned blue. 20 days later, the building had its first ever synchronized light show, using Alicia Keys' music.

            Traditionally, the building will lit New York's sports teams' color on the nights when they have home games. It is also illuminated in tennis-ball yellow during US Open in late August and early September. A week before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLVIII" target="_blank">Super Bowl XLVIII</a>, the building was lit according to the amounts of Twitter hashtags, either green and navy blue of the Seattle Seahawks or orange and blue of the Denver Broncos.
