<p><span id="firstword"><b>T</b></span>he war changed American fashion.With France and Italy, the original fashion hubs of the world embroiled in World War II, America suddenly found its foot in the fashion industry as trade between Italy, France, Germany and UK collapsed.The main source of silk in the world, China and Japan were completely cut-off. Fabric limitations lead designers to look for cheaper materials which led to the introduction of Nylon in fashion as a cheaper and a better replacement of silk. </p>
<p>In 1939 Nylon stockings were introduced at New York's World Fair to 3,000 women club members. When they hit the market a year later in 1940 over 750,000 pairs were reportedly sold on the first day for $1.25 a pair. May 15th, 1940 was called the "N-Day".</p>
