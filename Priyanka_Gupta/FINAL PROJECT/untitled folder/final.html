<p><span id="firstword"><b>T</b></span>he war changed American fashion.With France and Italy, the original fashion hubs of the world embroiled in World War II, America suddenly found its foot in the fashion industry as trade between Italy, France, Germany and UK collapsed.The main source of silk in the world, China and Japan were completely cut-off. Fabric limitations lead designers to look for cheaper materials which led to the introduction of Nylon in fashion as a cheaper and a better replacement of silk. </p>
<p>In 1939 Nylon stockings were introduced at New York's World Fair to 3,000 women club members. When they hit the market a year later in 1940 over 750,000 pairs were reportedly sold on the first day for $1.25 a pair. They sold out in the first two days. May 15th, 1940 was called the "N-Day".</p>

<span id="firstword"><b>O</b></span>n December 8, 1941, America entered the war. The War Production Board announced that nylon would now be used for war materials like parachutes,ropes, aircraft fuel, mosquito netting among others. Nylon stockings were in low supply and were being sold in the black market for $20/pair. Those who couldn't afford them came up with innovative solutions like leg makeup by using lotions and drawing lines down their legs to give the illusions of seams.</p>

<p>After the surrender of Japan in 1945 the main producer of Nylon stocking Dupont announced they are back in production but that wasn't enough. Thousands of women lined up at the stores across the country. In November, 30,000 women reportedly lined up in New York; 40,000 women in Pittsburgh queued up for a mere 13,000 pairs. </p>
