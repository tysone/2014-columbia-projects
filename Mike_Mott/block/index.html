				<span>Columbia students stroll by, backpacks on shoulders. A green borough taxi speeds past. Birds chirp.<br /><br />Like most Manhattan streets, the block beneath Columbia University is a busy one. Greek life is present, but like most cultures in New York City, is surrounded by many other forms of life.</span>

			<h1>Greek Brownstones</h1>
			<p>In a stronghold of fraternities and sororities, many of the buildings on the stretch of 114th Street between Amsterdam and Broadway make up a Greek alphabet. Some of these extend to 113th Street, however the grand majority are here.</p>
			<div>

			<p>Beginning off Broadway, these first three buildings reveal a Greek life in Columbia that is unique and similar. While they are different in history and goals, from the buildings at least, they appear in similar forms.</p>

			<p>There are of course many other elements to the block between Broadway and Amsterdam. Directly opposite the frats is Columbia University itself, where many students, members of the public, faculty and staff go to and fro.</p>
			<p>A hospital, St. Luke's, lays at Amsterdam and 114th. Strokos, a high-end deli, services both students and frequenters of the hospital.</p>
			<p>Still other buildings are on the block, including several dorms, Columbia-owned apartment buildings and the Intercultural Resource Center, center devoted to promoting diversity and creating a just society.</p>
