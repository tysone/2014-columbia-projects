			<p>Columbia University's greek life is small, but strong. In a stronghold of fraternities and sororities, many of the buildings on the stretch of 114th Street between Amsterdam and Broadway make up a Greek alphabet. Some of these extend to 113th Street, however the grand majority are here.</p>
			<p>There are other buildings (including my own), so it's interesting seeing students in Greek life interact with everyone else on this block.</p>

Formed in UCLA in the early 80's, the founders aimed to create a frat that bridged borders between ethnicities and national origins, since Asian fraternities and Sororities in the University of California were recognized only on those borders.

			<h1>West 114 Beyond Fraternities</h1>
			<p>There are of course many other elements to the block between Broadway and Amsterdam. Directly opposite the frats is Columbia Univeristy itself, where many students, members of the public, faculty and staff go to and fro.</p>
			<p>A hospital, St. Luke's, lays at Amsterdam and 114th. Strokos, a high-end deli, services both students and frequenters of the hospital.</p>
			<p>Still other buildings are on the block, including several dorms, Columbia-owned apartment buildings and the Intercultural Resource Center, center devoted to promoting diversity and creating a just society.</p>
