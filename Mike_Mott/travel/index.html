					<p>After taking steamship passage from New York via Panama, John Muir arrived in San Francisco, California in <a href="http://www.muirrambleroute.com/">1868</a>. Upon arrival, Muir immediately traveled to Yosemite for a week, a place he'd only read about.</p><p> He noted, <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/5yV7qVp6y">at first glance,</a> that, "he was overwhelmed by the landscape, scrambling down steep cliff faces to get a closer look at the waterfalls, whooping and howling at the vistas, jumping tirelessly from flower to flower."</p><p>Muir later served as a shepherd in Yosemite valley, climbed a number of the mountains there and hiked down old Indian trails. He designed mills, built cabins and most of all, wrote letters and stories in his journal.</p>

						<p>Ernest Hemingway wrote one of his most well-known short stories about this mountain — fittingly, "The Snows of Kilimanjaro".</p><p>The story reflects concerns he held as both a writer and a person — as someone acquainted with the wealthy, he was concerned that aspect of his life would damage his integrity as an author.</p><p>Hemingway complained on his second trip to Mt. Kilimanjaro that it didn't show itself for three weeks, referencing the mountain's famous cloud cover.</p>

						<p>James Hilton wrote <em>Lost Horizon</em> in 1938, a novel about the (supposed) fictional valley taken care of by lamas. The valley is described as mystical and harmonious, and since the story was published, "Shangri-La" has become a synonym for any place with those qualities.</p><p>There is speculation that Shangri-La is in the western end of the Himalayas, in the Hunza Valley in Northern Pakistan.</p><p>The Hunza valley, however, lacks Tibetan culture and Buddhism, a key element of <em>Lost Horizon</em>.</p><p><em>The Snow Leopard</em>, by Peter Mattheiessen, deserves equal recognition when mentioning the Himalayas — it was his book, based on his expedition tracking the rare snow leopard, that <em>The Economist</em> said first truly "crystallised" the sense that one might find oneself in the mountains.
