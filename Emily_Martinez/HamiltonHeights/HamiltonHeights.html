She's well-cared for by family and has a home attendant, but she forgets. Like she forgets my name and my mother's.

			<p class="content">Some of his favorite foods. If Juana and Euclides seem to look alike, it's because they're siblings. They live a block away from one another, and they both have Alzheimer's. They hardly see each other. When I showed her a photo of her brother my grandmother said, "Isn't he dead?" No, that's another brother. Delighted, she asked, <q>How did he look? Gordito?</q> Yes.
