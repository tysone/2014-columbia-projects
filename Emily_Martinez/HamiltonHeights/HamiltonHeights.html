		<p class="content">If my grandmother and Euclides seem to look alike, that's because they're brother and sister. They live a block away from one another, and they both have Alzheimer's. They hardly ever see each other, but when she speaks to his wife tersidad on the phone she explains that she's starving, which of course is not true. She's well-cared for by family and has a home attendant, but she forgets. Like she forgets my name and my mother's.

		When I showed her a photo of her brother, my grandmother said "wasn't he dead?" No, that was another brother. Realizing that he was in fact still alive, delighted she asked and how did he look? Gordito? 


		Hopes for this year? No she said, not at the moment.
		In the background, their son Joseluis gives her a hint. 

		La salud, mami

		Health, he said. Joseluis is recovering from heart surgery, and has just been diagnosed with skin cancer. He's having surgery next week. He said he inherited both diseases from his mother, who is a survivor. And she is their caretaker. 

		It's funny, Tersidad said, because when she was well she never wanted to visit. La memoria responded my grandfather, it's gone.</p>
