			My grandmother has lived on 136th street and Broadway for over 40 years. But lately, she's been wanting to go home. Home, to the Dominican Republic, which she never cared much to visit in health. She has Alzheimer's disease, and there are days she doesn't recognize her apartment, her children, her grandchildren. She remembers some things, my grandfather said in the recording above. The song she's singing was played at their wedding.

			<p class="content">Those are some of Euclides' favorite foods, all traditional Dominican dishes. If Juana and Euclides seem to look alike, it's because they're siblings. They live a block away from one another, and they both have Alzheimer's. When I showed her a photo of him my grandmother said, "Isn't he dead?" No, that's another brother. Delighted, she asked, <q>How did he look? Gordito?</q> Yes.
