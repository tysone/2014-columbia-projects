		 			<p>Six months ago this vacant space was decorated with bright colors and a 7-Eleven logo. Customers were constantly shuffeling in and out. In the mornings, majority of its customers consisted of teens and pre-teens who were looking to stock up on sweet treats before making their way to school. Ironically, twenty years before it was a 7-Eleven, part of it was a candy store owned by a man who's personality resembeled Willy Wonker. The other half was a TV repair shop.</p>

We used to play tag, jump double-dutch and race each other up and down this entire lot. Our favorite game to play was handball.

		 			<p>New Kam Lai is a Chinese restaurant that has served De Hostos residents, and surrounding communities, for 15 fifteen years. Vivienne, New Kam Lai's manager, describes her relationship with her customers as "wonderful." She often refers to us as her "family." We simply call her Vivvie.

		 			New Kam Lai caught an electrical fire in 2008. Vivienne and her workers were forced to take four years off as the restaurant was repaired. Business has been going better than ever since they reopened in 2012. "I don't ever plan on leaving this neighborhood," said Vivienne. "This is my home."</p>
