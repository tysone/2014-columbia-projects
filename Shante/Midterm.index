		 			<p>6 months ago this vacant retail space was plastered with a 7/Even logo, and full of customers shuffling in and out. In the mornings (mainly on weekdays) majority of its customers consisted of teens and preteens stocking up on sweet treats before making their way to school. Ironically, 20 years before it was a 7-Eleven, part of it was a candy store. The other half was a TV repair shop.</p>

We used to play tag, jump double-dutch and race each other up and down this entire lot. Our favorite game to play was handball. I can recall hitting the ball so hard on one occasion that it bounced over the wall and hit a window.</p>
