			<!--p>De Hostos Apartments is named after Eugenio Maria de Hostos. Hostos was an educator, humanist, abolitionist, philosopher, writer and politician. He advocated for Puerto Rico to be a part of the United States, as well as for its citizens to be recognized as U.S. citizens. He was born in 1839 and died in 1903.
			De Hostos Apartments is a 22-story building with 218 apartments, serving 480 residents. It’s located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan at 201 West 93 St. I’ve called it home for 24 years.</p-->

Ironically, twenty years before it was a 7-Eleven, part of this space was a candy store owned by a man who's personality resembeled Willy Wonker. The other half was a TV repair shop.</p>
