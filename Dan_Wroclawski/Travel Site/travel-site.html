				<p>With polar vortexes and relentless snowstorms, this winter has been one of the best in recent years for skiing and snowboarding. Below is an adaptation of <a href="http://www.hemispheresmagazine.com/2012/11/01/powder-play/">Powder Play</a>, which ran in the November 2012 issue of <em>Hemispheres</em>. These are some of the best mountains in the world. So what are you waiting for?</p>

					<h2>Whiteface Mountain</h2>
					<h3>Lake Placid, NY</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="text grid_4">
					<p>The names say it all: Cloudspin, Skyward, Lookout Below. Whiteface Mountain, located in New York&rsquo;s majestic Adirondacks, is renowned for having some of the most white-knuckle slopes in the eastern U.S., as well as the loftiest drop this side of the Rockies (3,430 feet). And while there are no trails called <q>Noobs, Do Not Even Think About Skiing Here,</q> the 35-acre expanse known as The Slides is a preferred spot for those who like to do their skiing in the absence of terrified howls. Often icy and littered with hazards, The Slides pretty much guarantees a noob-free day on the slopes.</p>

					<p>There&rsquo;s something gratuitous about the <q>double</q> in <q>double black diamond,</q> a term that calls to mind stacked adjectives like <q>super-mega-huge.</q> Why not just go with <q>black-diamond-times-infinity</q>? At Colorado&rsquo;s Telluride Ski Resort, this isn&rsquo;t so far off the mark. The Mak-M-Stairs-Plunge (steep, bumpy, unimaginably fast) is tough on the way down, while Palmyra Peak, with its 50-degree pitch, is just as hard on the way up (requiring a hike of more than an hour from the lift to reach the top).</p>

				<div class="text grid_4">
					<p>Rising to about 7,500 feet, Kronplatz is the Alpine equivalent of Tom Cruise: not the tallest fellow on the block, but extremely well turned out. Few ski areas on earth are subjected to such meticulous, obsessive grooming as this picturesque resort in Italy&rsquo;s Dolomites. The nightly efforts of Kronplatz&rsquo;s <q>slope heroes</q>&mdash;the folks who do the grooming&mdash;are especially heroic to those for whom turning and stopping are issues. <q>Making turns on good snow is better than on bumpy or broken snow,</q> deadpans Kronplatz spokesman Artur Costabiei. <q>It helps to prevent injuries and accidents.</q> Hear, hear.</p>

					<p>Skiing <q>the Roof of the World</q> may not be to everyone&rsquo;s taste, but if your idea of a good day out calls for remote, rugged, ridiculously elevated terrain with sublime scenery and scads of virgin snow, then heli-skiing the Indian Himalayas will not disappoint. One company to fly with out here is Himalayan Heli Adventures, which promises to transport you to trails some 16,000 feet up, with vertical drops exceeding 4,000 feet. And the thrills don&rsquo;t end at back-of-beyond hurtling: HHA&rsquo;s apr&egrave;s offerings include hot springs, temples, Tibetan monasteries, the Manali Bazaar and <q>snow leopards preying on flocks of goats.</q> That last bit isn&rsquo;t such a good thing for the goats, admittedly, but it&rsquo;ll make for an interesting anecdote to tell when you get back home.</p>

					<h2>Mad River Glen</h2>

				</div>
				<div class="text grid_4">
					<p>Mad River Glen is like one of those general stores you still find in Vermont&mdash;the ones selling apple cider made by a local named Mavis. There&rsquo;s a fierce dedication to tradition at this Fayston, Vt., resort, which opened more than half a century ago. The trails follow natural mountain contours and there&rsquo;s very little snowmaking. You ski as nature intended, or not at all. And when we say <q>ski,</q> we mean just that: The resort isn&rsquo;t open to snowboarders. As former owner Betsy Pratt reportedly sniffed, <q>Snowboarding on a ski mountain is like playing croquet on the 18th green. You can do it, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s appropriate.</q></p>

					<p>For inexperienced skiers, there must be something comforting about heading for Diamond Peak, given that this Nevada resort is located in a place called Incline Village as opposed to, say, Plummeter&rsquo;s Gulch. Fittingly, much of the resort is geared toward making the rookie&rsquo;s cross-trail pinging as pain-free as possible. The slopes at this Tahoe favorite tend to be gentle and&mdash;most important&mdash;wide. The patrons, moreover, are not the sort given to providing spirited commentaries when you cut them off.</p>

				<div class="text grid_4">
					<p>Being Norway&rsquo;s largest ski resort isn&rsquo;t the only thing that distinguishes Trysil, in the eastern county of Hedmark. It&rsquo;s also an exceptionally comely place. And, a couple of times a week, you can have it all to yourself (nearly) by joining its early morning ski sessions. The daybreak runs start at 7 a.m. with a <q>normal Norwegian breakfast</q> (cheesy crispbreads, ham rolls, etc.) in a small wooden hut at the base of Høgegga. This is the peak with the highest concentration of black-diamond slopes in the resort (whose longest run is 3.4 miles). H&oslash;gegga is, according to Trysil spokeswoman Lise Moen, <q>challenging even for the good skiers</q>&mdash;and yet there&rsquo;s a great sense of peace to be had hurtling down its deserted slopes, the sun just beginning to tinge the treetops. <q>All you can hear is the sound of your skis carving the virgin snow,</q> Moen says. <q>It&rsquo;s a special feeling.</q></p>

					<p>Most ski resorts celebrate opening day in one form or another, but Heavenly Mountain Resort in Lake Tahoe, Calif., takes the tradition to its extreme. Beginning with Winter Ignite, a 24-hour shindig at Heavenly&rsquo;s boisterous Tamarack Lodge, the festivities continue all week long with activities that range from rock concerts to displays by aerial acrobats. There is, however, a potential downside to all this merrymaking. <q>Heavenly leads the world in first chairs missed,</q> says Russell Pecoraro, the resort&rsquo;s communications director. <q>It&rsquo;s important to pace yourself, because if you go too big your first night, it can compromise the skiing aspect of your vacation.</q></p>

					<p>The breathtaking off-piste runs, the eye-bulging views, the brilliant black diamonds&mdash;none of it means a lot if you haven&rsquo;t got the right kind of snow. And for many skiers and snowboarders, the only right kind of snow is the powdery kind. The Champagne of snow. <q>The most delicate house of cards ever made.</q> Which is why they flock to Big White Ski Resort in Kelowna, British Columbia. Thanks to the area&rsquo;s copious snowfall, reliably low temperatures and relatively dry air, there are impressive heaps of the stuff here. As one powder aficionado emotes, <q>It gives a supreme feeling of freedom and mobility, a great sense of flying, moving anywhere in a great white paradise.</q></p>

					<p>If you&rsquo;re one of the brave few who enjoy telemark skiing, chances are you&rsquo;ve spent a fair amount of time hunting for a resort where your fellow skiers don&rsquo;t give you strange looks. At Colorado&rsquo;s Crested Butte Mountain Resort, you can be sure you&rsquo;ll be surrounded by plenty of like-minded folks. In fact, when telemark was in the midst of a rebirth in the 1970s, Crested Butte was the delivery room. As the home of the U.S. Telemark Extreme Freeskiing Championships, the resort boasts some of the most challenging telemark terrain around. But not everyone who skis here needs to be a pro, since its wide variety of terrain allows for seven levels of difficulty. As professional telemark skier and Crested Butte native Max Mancini observes, it&rsquo;s the kind of place where tele-heads come on holiday <q>and never leave.</q></p>
