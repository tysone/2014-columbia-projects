				<h2 id="subhead">The Heart of Little Italy</h2>

				<p>Little Italy has been on an unfortunate decline for years. Chinatown has grown up and around the neighborhood. The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/nyregion/22littleitaly.html?pagewanted=all">reported</a> on the neighborhood's dwindling population in 2011 and found that only five percent of the population was of Italian descent. It was even concluded that there was not one person living in the neighborhood who was born in Italy.</p>
				<p>Despite the dwindling Italian population, there are still holdouts. Mulberry Street is still alive and well, filled with Italian restaurants, cafes, and the occasional bakery.</p>

				<h2>Ferrara</h2>

			<div class="text prefix_3 grid_6 suffix_3">
				<p>The most well-known bakery is Ferrara, which is just off of Mulberry on Grand Street. The over 120-year-old institution is known around the world and will ship its Italian pastries right to your door.</p>

				<h2>Caffe Roma</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="text prefix_3 grid_6 suffix_3">
				<p>Caffe Roma, a block up Mulberry on the corner of Broome Street, is just as old as Ferrara's, but not as well-known. It is also a bakery and cafe <a href="http://nymag.com/listings/stores/caffe-roma/">known</a> for its own hard-to-pronounce Italian treats like sfogliatella and pasticciotto.</p>

				<h2>Grotta Azzurra Ristorante</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="text prefix_3 grid_6 suffix_3">
				<p>Another historic restaurant sits across from Caffe Roma on Mulberry called <a href="http://www.bluegrotta.com/">Grotta Azzurra</a>. This restaurant was founded in 1908 and inspired by the famous caves of the Italian island Capri. It was closed down for six years, but is now back with a newly renovated interior.</p>

				<h2>Benito One and Aqua Star Pet Shop</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="text prefix_3 grid_6 suffix_3">
				<p>Despite the institutions that line Mulberry Street, Chinatown has made in-roads into this last Italian stronghold. Aqua Star Pet Shop stands out next to Benito One, a long-standing Little Italy restaurant.</p>

				<p>While Little Italy may be shrinking, the neighborhood still has a deep history. This memorial outside The Church of the Most Precious Blood honors the military men of the neighborhood who lost their lives in war.</p>

				<p>Little Italy may have a troubled future, but Mulberry Street is still alive and well. Even in winter, it is dotted with outdoor cafe tables, inviting people to try tasty Italian cuisine. And for the foreseeable future, the statue of Sal below will continue to stand tall.</p>
