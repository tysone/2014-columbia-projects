				<p>Little Italy has been on an unfortunate decline for years. Chinatown has grown up and around the neighborhood. The New York Times reported on the neighborhood's dwindling population in 2011 and found that only five percent of the population was of Italian descent. It was even concluded that there was not one person living in the neighborhood who was born in Italy.</p>
				<p>Despite the dwindling Italian population, there are still holdouts. Mulberry Street is still alive and well, filled with Italian restaurants, cafes, and the occasional bakery.</p>

				<p>The most well-known bakery is Ferrara, which is just off of Mulberry on Grand Street. The over 120-year-old institution is known around the world and will ship its Italian pastries right to your door.</p>
