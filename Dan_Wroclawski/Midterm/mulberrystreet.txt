Mulberry Street
The Heart of Little Italy

Little Italy has been on an unfortunate decline for years. Chinatown has grown up and around the neighborhood. The New York Times reported on the neighborhood’s dwindling population in 2011 and found that only five percent of the population was of Italian descent. It was even concluded that there was not one person living in the neighborhood who was born in Italy.

Despite the dwindling Italian population, there are still holdouts. Mulberry Street is still alive and well, filled with Italian restaurants, cafes, and the occasional bakery.

The most well-known bakery is Ferrara, which is just off of Mulberry on Grand Street. The over 120-year-old institution is known around the world and will ship its Italian pastries right to your door.

Caffe Roma, a block up Mulberry on the corner of Broome Street, is just as old as Ferrara’s, but not as well-known. It is also a bakery and cafe known for its own hard-to-pronounce Italian treats like sfogliatella and pasticciotto.

Another historic restaurant sits across from Caffe Roma on Mulberry called Grotta Azzurra. This restaurant was founded in 1908 and inspired by the famous caves of the Italian island Capri. It was closed down for six years, but is now back with a newly renovated interior.

Despite the institutions that line Mulberry Street, Chinatown has made in-roads into the last Italian stronghold.
