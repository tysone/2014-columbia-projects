				<p>Would you buy a wristband that could track the nutrients in your bloodstream? How about a pendant that tracks your dog’s fitness levels? Or perhaps an armband that allows you to control every electronic device in your home without actually touching them? These devices may seem like science fiction, but they are all in development today.</p>
				<p>Wearable technology is a rapidly growing sector of digital devices that aim to integrate our digital lives with life outside computer and smartphone screens. Google is expected to release its Glass eyegear in 2014 and some analysts predict that Apple will soon debut an “iWatch” smartwatch. Samsung just released its own smartwatch in October called the Galaxy Gear and Sony released an updated smartwatch as well.</p>
				<p>Currently, wearables are primarily divided between two categories--health and fitness monitoring and glanceable information. One of the most popular fitness wearables is Nike’s popular FuelBand, which measures how much you move when running, working out, or even walking. Other big players in fitness wearables are Jawbone’s UP wristband and Fitbit’s wristbands. All of these devices track movement, but the Jawbone and Fitbit differentiate their products with other features. Fitbit’s wristbands also tracks sleep while the Jawbone UP tracks sleep as well as food intake with a companion smartphone app.</p>
				<p>The other major category of wearable devices is those that provide glanceable information. These devices will notify you of incoming calls, emails, social network notifications, and even information related to your current location. The most well-known and somewhat controversial device in this category is Google Glass. The device, which consists of a small screen, camera, touchpad, and headphones that are built into a glasses frame, will allow users to make video calls, take pictures and videos, and of course, search the web via Google for everything from nearby restaurants to language translations.</p>

				<p>Many more wearables are reported to be in the works. Numbers vary, but according to a press release from market analysis firm MarketsandMarkets, the wearable device market is expected to be worth $8.36 billion by 2018.</p>
				<p>But despite the market valuations and interest from industry heavyweights, wearables still have some obstacles to overcome. “I think 2014 is the year where the really big companies start to really play in this space because right now it’s been mostly small companies like us,” said Karl Martin, CEO of Bionym, which is making a wearable device called the Nymi. The wristband tracks a user’s heartbeat and transforms it into a wireless passcode for making secure payments, or unlocking a car, among other applications.</p>
				<p>“From what I can tell, everything is the next baby step, which is fine, but I don’t know if 2014 is going to be much different than just the next step,” said Mike Lovas, co-founder and Chief Design Officer of PUSH, a company creating an armband that measures force, velocity, and power for athletes that weightlift.</p>
				<p>Public suspicion is a major hurdle. Google Glass has already been banned from some restaurants and bars because of fears that users might record unwitting patrons with the built-in camera.</p>
				<p>“You cannot ignore the fact that you feel kind of distant to someone wearing Google Glass,” said Martin Kallstrom, CEO of Narrative, a Swedish company building the Narrative Clip, a small “lifelogging” camera that clips onto clothing. “There is something between you and them.”</p>
				<p>“There’s always been those taboos and kind of awkward moments of when technology gets introduced,” said Lovas. Wearables take that one step further. “It does look weird when you have a computer hanging off another person’s head,” he said.</p>
