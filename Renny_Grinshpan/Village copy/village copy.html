<div class="Intro">
<p>The block of Macdougal Street between Bleecker Street and West 3rd Street in the heart of Greenwich Village is as New York as it gets. It has seen some serious history - and has the local landmarks to show for it. Always a tourist destination, the block today seems to have reached the limit of its tourist trappings - what with nearly every square inch of it being filled with signage. Check out this short series on the block. You'll see what I mean.</p>

<p>Macdougal Street is particularly well-known for its live music and comedy scenes. These comedy clubs admit several hundred patrons a night, a particularly easy feat for'Comedy Cellar,' which has featured nearly every notable American comedian. 'Comedy Club' increases its numbers by stationing a promoter outside its entrance. You cannot walk from one end of Macdougal to the other without hearing encouragement from at least one of these fixtures to check out their clubs.</p>

<p>The cafes on Macdougal are staple tourist destinations of Greenwich Village. Bob Dylan had his first gig in New York at 'Cafe Wha?' which is also famous as the venue for some of Jimi Hendrix's early shows. The coffeehouse 'Caffe Reggio,' which has been open since 1927, features in many films, including, most recently, the Oscar-nominated "Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen Brothers movie. Many celebrities have been spotted or photographed here.</p>

<div class="content5">
<p>All in all, yes - Macdougal St is a giant tourist trap. But with its rich history and diverse offerings for passing time, it is also the place to feel like a true New Yorker.</p>
