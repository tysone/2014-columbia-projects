	<p>Being one of the most popular cities for the arts, New York City's museums, playhouses, and jazz bars are nearly always packed. But while these cultural centers are constantly welcoming new patrons, one of the city's oldest and most influential cultural hubs has locked its doors.</p>

	<p>Built between 1883 and 1885, the Chelsea Hotel, also known as the Hotel Chelsea, has regularly been home to famous singers, writers, poets, artists, and actors for over a century.</p>

	<p>Some of the world's greatest <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sherill-tippins-/famous-authors-who-lived-_b_4378691.html">writers</a> found inspiration at the hotel. Mark Twain, Dylan Thomas, Tennessee Williams, Charles Bukowski, and Arthur Miller all wrote at the Chelsea.</p>

	<p>Famous artists like Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, Ching Ho Cheng, and Larry Rivers all left their marks at the hotel, quite literally. The walls of the hotel were covered in artwork from former guests until 2011 when management decided to take all the work down for preservation during remodeling.</p>

	<h3>The Present and the Future...</h3>

	<p>The lobby of the hotel still has the quirky charm created by the gifts that former guests left behind. As the hotel continues undergoing renovations and ownership acquisitions (the last one was in 2013), a select few residents get to call the Chelsea Hotel home, while others can only reminisce and wonder what the new owners have in store.</p>

	<div class="poem">
	<p1>Anita! Soon this Chelsea Hotel<br>
	Will vanish before the city&#39;s merchant greed,
	<br>Wreckers will wreck it, and in its stead<br>
	More lofty walls will swell<br>
	<br> 
	This old street&#39;s populace. Then who will know
	<br>About its ancient grandeur, marble stairs,<br>
	Its paintings, onyx-mantels, courts, the heirs<br>
	Of a time now long ago? . . .<br>
	<br>
	&#34;The Hotel Chelsea&#34; by Edgar Lee Masters (1936)</p1>
