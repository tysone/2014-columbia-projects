			<p>Being one of the most popular cities for the arts, New York City's museums, playhouses, and jazz bars are nearly always packed. But while these cultural centers are constantly welcoming new patrons, one of the city's oldest and most influential cultural hubs has locked its doors. <br><br>
			Built between 1883 and 1885, the Chelsea Hotel, also known as the Hotel Chelsea, has regularly been home to famous singers, writers, poets, artists, and actors for over a century.<br> <br>

		<p> The Chelsea hosted some of the most popular musicians in the world including Madonna, Edith Piaf, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, and Pink Floyd, to name a few. Many of the artists met each other at the hotel and subsequently spent time together. Musician and poet, Leonard Cohen, frequently stayed at the hotel, and like other artists, met many friends there including Janis Joplin, who he wrote the song 'Chelsea Hotel No.2' about. When asked about his experiences at the hotel, Cohen once said, "It's one of those hotels that have everything that I love so well about hotels. I love hotels to which, at four a.m., you can bring along a midget, a bear and four ladies, drag them to your room and no one cares about it at all." </p>

			<p>Some of the world's greatest <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sherill-tippins-/famous-authors-who-lived-_b_4378691.html">writers</a> found inspiration at the hotel. Mark Twain, Dylan Thomas, Tennessee Williams, Charles Bukowski, and Arthur Miller all wrote at the Chelsea. Like the many musicians that stayed at the hotel, the writers also met their counterparts and formed lasting friendships. In 1953, Jack Kerouac hit the town with Gore Vidal before returning to the hotel and talking about their mutual admiration for Thomas Wolfe and Dylan Thomas, both of whom also stayed at the hotel.</p>

			<p>Famous artists like Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, Ching Ho Cheng, and Larry Rivers all left their marks at the hotel, quite literally. The walls of the hotel were covered in artwork from former guests until 2011 when management decided to take all the work down for preservation during remodeling.</p>

			<p>The lobby of the hotel still has the quirky charm created by the gifts that former guests left behind. As the hotel continues undergoing renovations and ownership acquisitions (the last one was in 2013), a select few residents get to call the Chelsea Hotel home, while others can only reminisce and wonder what the new owners have in store.</p>

			<p>Anita! Soon this Chelsea Hotel<br>
			Will vanish before the city&#39;s merchant greed,
			<br>Wreckers will wreck it, and in its stead<br>
			More lofty walls will swell<br><br> 
			This old street&#39;s populace. Then who will know
			<br>About its ancient grandeur, marble stairs,<br>
			Its paintings, onyx-mantels, courts, the heirs<br>
			Of a time now long ago? . . .<br><br>
			&#34;The Hotel Chelsea&#34; by Edgar Lee Masters (1936)</p>
