        <div class="blah"><div class="cap">D</div>ecades ago, labels like &quot;gay,&quot; &quot;lesbian&quot; and &quot;homosexual&quot; were the extent to which those inside and outside of the queer community defined their sexualities in the mainstream. Through the 1990s and early 2000s, the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgender) acronym became more popular and today, it is safe to say that the majority of Americans are aware of what the acronym stands, for and a large portion use it regularly. But, in the last few years the acronym has grown considerably to LGBTQQIP2SAA and with that elongation came questions within both the queer and heterosexual communities about whether or not the elongated acronym was beneficial or detrimental to the identities it represents.

                 <div class="together"><div class="box1">
                    Carol Demech, a lesbian in her sixties with short, curly salt and pepper hair, regularly comes to the SAGE (Services &amp; Advocacy for Gay Elders) center and says that she was part of that history. As she clasps her coffee mug, the eyes behind her thick glasses grow wider and match the passion in her voice as she recalls her place in history, &quot;I was alive during Stonewall and saw a lot of the other protests, too. We fought hard.We fought too hard and I don't want those words to be lost. You can call me a lesbian, a dyke, whatever. I fought for those words. I fought for that identity.&quot;
                    <br><br>
                    Demech says that she sees the need for other identities to be recognized, but disagrees with the suggestion that everyone be labeled with the same umbrella term, such as &lsquo;queer&rsquo;, &quot;Everybody wants to be heard, add them all on &#91;to the acronym&#92; and that's fine but don't forget how hard we fought to be able to use the word lesbian proudly. I don't want us to ever lose &lsquo;lesbian&rsquo; or &lsquo;gay&rsquo;.&quot;
                    <br><br>
                    Although Demech strongly stands by her desire to keep &quot;lesbian&quot; and &quot;gay&quot; in the acronym she says that her own opinion won't change what's already going on, &quot;Everyone has a voice and a way they want to identify themselves now. Look at what Facebook just did.&quot;
                    <br><br>
                    In February, Facebook, in conjunction with GLAAD (Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation), launched a new initiative that allows users to identify themselves not just as &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot; but as any variation of 56 custom gender options and also allows users to choose what specific gender pronoun they prefer. The custom gender options, which range from the identities represented in the longer LGBT acronym to lesser known terms like &quot;transfeminine&quot; and &quot;neutrois,&quot; garnered both positive and negative reactions.

                <div class="box2">Perhaps the most widely recognizable element of the acronym, the word &quot;gay,&quot; was for decades used as an umbrella term for nearly everyone in the queer community. Shortly after the women's rights movement of the 1970s, the term &quot;lesbian&quot; became more widely used in place of &quot;gay&quot; when it came to describing queer women. The gay community's stance on the acronym ranges from apathy to support to anger and outrage over how long it has become. The gay rights movement, that Demech metioned, also empowered gay men to be proud in representing themselves as gay and some still struggle with the length of the acronym impeding on that pride.

                <div class="together3"><div class="box3">
               Robyn Ochs is an educator, LGBT activist and author of &quot;Getting Bi: Voices of Bisexuals Around the World&quot;. Throughout her career, Ochs says she has come to realize that the acronym is more than a slew of letters, it's also about messaging.
               <br><br>
               &quot;A lot of the work of LGBT advocacy organizations, or any advocacy organization really, is messaging. It's figuring out how do you say what you want to say in a way that other people can hear it. And sometimes the most affective way in the shorter term to do that is to shorten the message, to simplify the message, to use language that doesn't offend anybody, to eliminate any of those parts of the message that might be messy or untidy or objectionable to some people and there in there you have a conflict between respecting people's complex, messy, untidy realities and trying to talk to people who are so low on the clue ladder that you know if you get too real you're going to lose them.&quot;
               <br> <br>
               Ochs acknowledges the problematic nature of having labels attached to something as unique and fluid as a human identity. For Ochs, and many others, the labels extend beyond their social circles and are permeating into the subconscious of both politics and society.
               <br> <br>
               &quot;Take for instance marriage equality. People repeatedly call it gay marriage. It's not gay marriage, it's marriage equality. There are so many complications that people who are bi or trans have to go experience when it comes to marriage and labeling it as gay marriage gives everyone the wrong idea.&quot;
               <br> <br>
               Ochs' statement brings up the question of why labels are needed at all. If marriage is marriage, then why is a classification needed to distinguish between gay marriage and heterosexual marriage, the latter hardly if ever being used.

               <div class="definitions" id="Tdefinition"><b>Transgender:</b> used most often as an umbrella term, some commonly held definitions: 1. Someone whose gender identity or expression does not fit within dominant-group social constructs of assigned sex and gender. 2. A gender outside of the man/woman binary. 3. Having no gender or multiple genders.</div>

               <div class="box4">The transgender community's view on the acronym is hard to gauge. Though increased exposure has been a result of having the &quot;T&quot; in the shortened LGBT acronym, there are still many misconceptions with how the group is addressed and treated. For example, many are confused on what exactly the T stands for. Transgender? Transgendered? Transexual? Transvestite? Some of these are incorrect, like &quot;transgendered&quot; &#40;there is no &#45;ed at the end&#41;, while others are now considered inappropriate, like &quot;transvestite&quot;.

                <div class="box5">
                Simplifying the message may, in fact, be necessary in order for the LGBT community to gain traction and widespread support, but some say that adapting the consciousness and identity of the LGBT community to the hetero-normative standards of understanding would be disparaging to the group.
                <br> <br>
                &quot;People should know what each of the letters stands for because they need to know that there are people out there who identify as a sex or gender that they may not know of,&quot; says Sara*, a college student who identifies as queer.
                <br> <br>
                &quot;I'm queer. Not gay. Not a lesbian. But queer. That's the way I choose to describe myself and I would hope that the rest of the world would respect that and want to see me as the way I see myself. And in the end if you don't know what queer means or it confuses you then figure it out, don't make people change their way of seeing the world just because you don't have the time or energy to figure it out.&quot;

                <div class="box6">Aaron Finkel, 24-year-old college student, who identifies as &quot;questioning,&quot; applauds Facebook's decision, &quot;I've been using Facebook for 5 or 6 years and I've questioned my gender and identity every day during those years. I think it's empowering, for me, and other people that are questioning their gender or sexuality to be able to choose a gender that matches who they are on the inside and not just something as simple as 'male' or female'.&quot;
                <br> <br>
                Finkel says the change has not only had a positive effect on him, but also on his extended family. &quot;I told my family that I was unsure of my gender over the holiday break a couple years ago. It's been hard to explain to them over the holidays how I feel about it, but when the Facebook change happened my grandma actually got in touch with me and asked which option I would choose. It seemed like she was really curious about where I was at and struggling to find some way to gauge it and I think Facebook gave her that.&quot;</div>

                <div class="box8">Roger M., who has come out to his friends, but not his family, always knew that he was different. From the age of 10, Roger says that he has not been attracted to just one gender, &quot;It was Valentine's Day and everyone was handing out the little cards to other students in the class. You had to bring one for everyone, girls and boys. I remember thinking, 'How cool, everyone likes everyone. I don't have to just pick between guys and girls.' Of course, after that I realized that giving someone a mandatory Valentine didn't mean that everyone was free to love whoever they wanted. That experience stuck with me, though, because I realized that that's what I wanted &#45; to be able to love whoever without worrying about their gender.&quot;
                <br><br>
                Roger identified as bi-sexual until an experience he had in college, which he said was both enlightening and extremely confusing.
                <br><br>
                &quot;It was sophomore year and I was with a group of friends going to a gay bar. The night was going great, everyone was dancing, drinking, having fun. Then I noticed this transgender woman who came up and started dancing with me. I always knew that I liked both men and women, but I never really thought about being with someone who was transgender or transexual. In the end, her and I had a great time and became really good friends. I did a ton of research and talked to counselors to try to figure out how to redefine myself and by my senior year of college I knew that I was pan&#91;sexual&#92;.&quot;
                <br><br>
                Pansexuality, an attraction to anyone regardless of gender or sexuality, has been known in psychology since the early 1900s, but only recently has it caught the attention of modern society.
                In 2012, the first Texas State Representative who was openly lesbian, Mary Gonzalez, told The Dallas Voice that she was actually pansexual, something that Gonzalez knew since college but was not comfortable admitting.
                <br><br>
                &quot;During the campaign if I had identified as pansexual, I would have overwhelmed everyone,&quot; she told The Dallas Voice. &quot;Now that I&rsquo;m out of the campaign, I&rsquo;m completely much more able to define it.&quot;
                <br><br>
                Gonzalez's &quot;coming out&quot; introduced millions of Americans to pansexuality as another sexual identity that they may have not previously known about. Roger says that Gonzalez's coming out was an inspiration to him, &quot;After I saw that someone so powerful and in the spotlight was able to come out, I found it very inspiring. I was able to tell my best friend that I was pan and have been telling more friends since then. I'm still too scared to tell my family because a lot of people still don't know what pan is and some people even think it's like a joke.&quot;
                <br><br>
                As with the transformation of &quot;gay&quot; and &quot;homosexual&quot; to LGBT, the transformation of LGBT to a longer, more inclusive acronym could mean a lot to people like Roger.
                <br><br>
                &quot;My aunts, who are really old school, say LGBT now. When I was little they would say &quot;gay&quot; a lot when talking about someone who wasn't straight, but now they're using LGBT, which I think is really cool. I really hope that in a couple years it can be something like LGBTP or something that includes everyone,&quot; adding, &quot;I really want to come out to my family and be myself around them but pansexuality is still too out there. If more people used it regularly like LGBT then I think it would be good for people like me. Yeah, I'd be a lot happier.&quot;</div>

                <div class="box9">Probably the least known and most exclusive of all of the identities, the two-spirit community is reluctant to talk about their views on both their role in the community and the impact of the acronym on their group identity. Some Native American communities appreciate and respect two-spirited people, while other communities are not as tolerant. The divide within the Native American community coupled with the general American lack of knowledge about two-spirit, has made it difficult for the community to have their voices heard.

                <div class="box10">Members of the asexual community have been in numerous debates, including some over the acronym. Only about 1&#37; of the population consider themselves asexual and the scientific, medical and psychological communities are barely starting to explore asexuality and whether it is, in fact, a true gender or sexual identity. Some members of the community approve of being included in the acronym, while others find the heirarchy of the acronym, and asexuality's position on it, to be perplexing.

                According to a 2013 Gallup poll, 52&#37; of Americans said they would be in favor of legalizing gay marriage in all 50 states. By most definitions, this 52&#37; would be considered allies in the LGBT movement for equal rights. By including allies in the LGBT acronym, the minority does, in fact, become a majority. Some believe the intention of the longer acronym is to be more inclusive to sexual and gender minority communities, but by including allies, the group, as a whole, is comprised of every single American except those who are heterosexual, cisgender, and opposed to equal rights. Not such a minority group when most Americans are included in it.
                <br><br>
                The same Gallup poll, conducted in 1996, showed that only 27&#37; of Americans believed that gay marriage should be legalized nationwide. The fact that this percentage has nearly doubled in 17 years supports the idea that there are now more LGBT allies than ever in our nation's history, and if the trend continues, there will be even more in the future.
                <br><br>
                It can be argued that the inclusion of allies, makes the acronym representative of the American majority, and takes the focus away from the original minority, which is still clearly present. According to a 2011 UCLA Williams Institute study, 3.5% of the U.S. population identifies as lesbian, gay or bisexual while only 0.3% identify as transgender. Significantly lower than the 52&#37; of allies, these percentages demonstrate just how small of a minority the LGBT community is comprised of. By grouping this miniscule minority with allies in the acronym, this subjugated minority is drowned out by the inclusion of the majority in its group identity.
                <br><br>
                Although including allies is problematic when the LGBT community uses the acronym to symbolize a common group identity, allies are beneficial in the fight for equal rights and should not simply be overlooked. The acronym is just as important to allies as it is to members of the LGBT+ community.
                <br><br>
                Bill Fusco, identifies himself as an ally and he finds the longer version of the acronym to be not only unnecessary, but silly, &quot;It's ridiculous. I mean, come on. It's good to include everyone and make everyone feel comfortable but if I'm an ally and can't even pronounce the cause I'm supporting without stuttering or losing track of the letters that's a really big disadvantage for the whole community.&quot;
